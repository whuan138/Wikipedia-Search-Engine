Standard IPNI form: \n\n\nMary Agnes Chase, née Merrill, was an American botanist who worked at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Smithsonian Institution. She is considered one of the world's outstanding agrostologists and is known for her work on the study of grasses, and also for her work as a suffragist. Chase was born in Iroquois County, Illinois and held no formal education beyond grammar school. That aside, she made significant contributions to the field of botany, authored over 70 scientific publications, and was conferred with an honorary doctorate in science from the University of Illinois. She specialized in the study of grasses and conducted extensive field work in North- as well as and South America. Her \n is archived in the Smithsonian Institution Archives.\n\nIn 1901, Chase became a botanical assistant at the Field Museum of Natural History under \n, where her work was featured in two museum publications: \n (1900) and \n (1904). Two years later, Chase joined the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a botanical illustrator and eventually became a scientific assistant in systematic agrostology (1907), assistant botanist (1923), and associate botanist (1925), all under \n. Chase worked with Hitchcock for almost twenty years, collaborating closely and also publishing, for instance \n (1910).\n\nFollowing Hitchcock's death in 1936, Chase succeeded him to become senior botanist in charge of systematic agrostology and custodian of the Section of Grasses, Division of Plants at the United States National Museum (USNM). Chase retired from the USDA in 1939, but continued her work as custodian of the USNM grass herbarium until her death in 1963. She was an Honorary Fellow of the Smithsonian Institution (1959) and Fellow of the Linnean Society of London (1961). \n is named in her honour (a monotypic genus of herbaceous South American bamboo in the grass family).\n\nChase experienced discrimination based on her gender in the scientific field, for example, being excluded from expeditions to Panama in 1911 and 1912 because the expedition's benefactors feared the presence of women researchers would distract men. During World War I, Chase marched with Alice Paul and was jailed several times for her activities. In 1918, she was arrested at the Silent Sentinels rally picketing the White House; she refused bail and was held for 10 days, where she instigated a hunger-strike and was force-fed. The USDA accused her of \"conduct unbecoming a government employee,\" but Hitchcock helped her keep her job. Chase was also an active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).\n\n\n\n\n\nSome facts on this fish:\n\n: Males: up to 3 cm.

Its main figures were Bomis CEO \n and \n, \n for Nupedia and later Wikipedia.\n Nupedia was initially licensed under its own Nupedia \n License, but before Wikipedia was founded, Nupedia switched to the \n at the urging of \n.\n Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,\n while Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a \n to reach that goal.\n On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a \"feeder\" project for Nupedia.\n\n\nThe \n \n and \n (later redirecting to \n) were registered on January 13, 2001,\n and January 12, 2001,\n respectively. Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001\n as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,\n and was announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.\n The name originated from a \n of the words \n and \n.\n Its integral policy of \"neutral point-of-view\"\n was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were initially relatively few rules, and it operated independently of Nupedia.\n Bomis originally intended for it to be a for-profit business.\n\n\nWikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, \n postings, and web \n indexing. Language editions were created beginning in March 2001, with a total of 161 in use by the end of 2004.\n Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The \n passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing the \n made during the \n in 1408, which had held the record for almost 600 years.\n\n\nCiting fears of commercial \n and lack of control, users of the \n forked from Wikipedia to create \n in February 2002.\n Wales then announced that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and changed Wikipedia's domain from \n to \n.\n\n\nThough the English Wikipedia reached three million articles in August 2009, the growth of the edition, in terms of the numbers of new articles and of editors, appears to have peaked around early 2007.\n Around 1,800 articles were added daily to the encyclopedia in 2006; by 2013 that average was roughly 800.\n A team at the \n attributed this slowing of growth to the project's increasing exclusivity and resistance to change.\n Others suggest that the growth is flattening naturally because articles that could be called \"\n\"—topics that clearly merit an article—have already been created and built up extensively.\n\n\n\nIn November 2009, a researcher at the \n in \n, Spain found that the English Wikipedia had lost 49,000 editors during the first three months of 2009; in comparison, it lost only 4,900 editors during the same period in 2008.\n \n cited the array of rules applied to editing and disputes related to such content among the reasons for this trend.\n Wales disputed these claims in 2009, denying the decline and questioning the study's methodology.\n Two years later, in 2011, he acknowledged a slight decline, noting a decrease from \"a little more than 36,000 writers\" in June 2010 to 35,800 in June 2011. In the same interview, he also claimed the number of editors was \"stable and sustainable\".\n A 2013 \n article, \"The Decline of Wikipedia\", questioned this claim, revealing that since 2007, Wikipedia had lost a third of its volunteer editors, and that those remaining had focused increasingly on minutiae.\n In July 2012, \n reported that the number of administrators was also in decline.\n In the November 25, 2013, issue of \n magazine, Katherine Ward stated, \"Wikipedia, the sixth-most-used website, is facing an internal crisis.\"\n\n\nThe number of active English Wikipedia editors has since remained steady after a long period of decline.\n\n\nIn January 2007, Wikipedia first became one of the ten \n in the United States, according to \n Networks.\n With 42.9 million unique visitors, it was ranked #9, surpassing \n (#10) and \n (#11).\n This marked a significant increase over January 2006, when Wikipedia ranked 33rd, with around 18.3 million unique visitors.\n In 2014, it received eight billion page views every month.\n On February 9, 2014, \n reported that Wikipedia had 18 billion \n and nearly 500 million \n a month, \"according to the ratings firm comScore\".\n As of March 2023\n, it ranked 6th in popularity, according to \n.\n Loveland and Reagle argue that, in process, Wikipedia follows a long tradition of historical encyclopedias that have accumulated improvements piecemeal through \"\n accumulation\".\n\n\n\nOn January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia participated in a series of coordinated protests against two proposed laws in the \n—the \n (SOPA) and the \n (PIPA)—by \n.\n More than 162 million people viewed the blackout explanation page that temporarily replaced its content.\n\n\nIn January 2013, \n, an \n, was named after Wikipedia;\n in October 2014, Wikipedia was honored with the \n;\n and, in July 2015, 106 of the 7,473 700-page volumes of Wikipedia became available as \n.\n In April 2019, an Israeli \n, \n, crash landed on the surface of the \n carrying a copy of nearly all of the English Wikipedia engraved on thin nickel plates; experts say the plates likely survived the crash.\n In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of article text from the English Wikipedia had been encoded into \n.\n\n\nOn January 20, 2014, Subodh Varma reporting for \n indicated that not only had Wikipedia's growth stalled, it \"had lost nearly ten percent of its page views last year. There was a decline of about two billion between December 2012 and December 2013. Its most popular versions are leading the slide: page-views of the English Wikipedia declined by twelve percent, those of German version slid by 17 percent and the Japanese version lost nine percent.\"\n Varma added, \"While Wikipedia's managers think that this could be due to errors in counting, other experts feel that Google's \n project launched last year may be gobbling up Wikipedia users.\"\n When contacted on this matter, \n, associate professor at New York University and fellow at Harvard's \n said that he suspected much of the page-view decline was due to Knowledge Graphs, stating, \"If you can get your question answered from the search page, you don't need to click [any further].\"\n By the end of December 2016, Wikipedia was ranked the fifth most popular website globally.\n\n\nAs of January 2023, 55,791 English Wikipedia articles have been cited 92,300 times in scholarly journals,\n from which \n was the most cited page.\n\n\nOn January 18, 2023, Wikipedia debuted a new website redesign, called \"Vector 2022\".\n It featured a redesigned \n, moving the \n to the left as a \n, and numerous changes in the locations of buttons like the language selection tool.\n The update initially received backlash, most notably when editors of the \n unanimously voted to revert the changes.\n\n\nUnlike traditional encyclopedias, Wikipedia follows the \n principle regarding the security of its content, meaning that it waits until a problem arises to fix it.\n\n\nDue to Wikipedia's increasing popularity, some editions, including the English version, have introduced editing restrictions for certain cases. For instance, on the English Wikipedia and some other language editions, only registered users may create a new article.\n On the English Wikipedia, among others, particularly controversial, sensitive, or vandalism-prone pages have been protected to varying degrees.\n A frequently vandalized article can be \"semi-protected\" or \"extended confirmed protected\", meaning that only \"autoconfirmed\" or \"extended confirmed\" editors can modify it.\n A particularly contentious article may be locked so that only \n can make changes.\n A 2021 article in the \n identified Wikipedia's page-protection policies as \"perhaps the most important\" means at its disposal to \"regulate its market of ideas\".\n\n\nIn certain cases, all editors are allowed to submit modifications, but review is required for some editors, depending on certain conditions. For example, the \n maintains \"stable versions\" of articles which have passed certain reviews.\n Following protracted trials and community discussion, the English Wikipedia introduced the \"pending changes\" system in December 2012.\n Under this system, new and unregistered users' edits to certain controversial or vandalism-prone articles are reviewed by established users before they are published.\n\n\nAlthough changes are not systematically reviewed, Wikipedia's software provides tools allowing anyone to review changes made by others. Each article's History page links to each revision.\n On most articles, anyone can view the latest changes and undo others' revisions by clicking a link on the article's History page. Registered users may maintain a \"watchlist\" of articles that interest them so they can be notified of changes.\n \"New pages patrol\" is a process where newly created articles are checked for obvious problems.\n\n\nIn 2003, economics PhD student Andrea Ciffolilli argued that the low \n of participating in a \n created a catalyst for collaborative development, and that features such as allowing easy access to past versions of a page favored \"creative construction\" over \"creative destruction\".\n\n\nAny change that deliberately compromises Wikipedia's integrity is considered vandalism. The most common and obvious types of vandalism include additions of obscenities and crude humor; it can also include advertising and other types of spam.\n Sometimes editors commit vandalism by removing content or entirely blanking a given page. Less common types of vandalism, such as the deliberate addition of plausible but false information, can be more difficult to detect. Vandals can introduce irrelevant formatting, modify page semantics such as the page's title or categorization, manipulate the article's underlying code, or use images disruptively.\n\n\nObvious vandalism is generally easy to remove from Wikipedia articles; the median time to detect and fix it is a few minutes.\n However, some vandalism takes much longer to detect and repair.\n\n\nIn the \n, an anonymous editor introduced false information into the biography of American political figure \n in May 2005, falsely presenting him as a suspect in the \n.\n It remained uncorrected for four months.\n Seigenthaler, the founding editorial director of \n and founder of the Freedom Forum \n at \n, called Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales and asked whether he had any way of knowing who contributed the misinformation. Wales said he did not, although the perpetrator was eventually traced.\n After the incident, Seigenthaler described Wikipedia as \"a flawed and irresponsible research tool\".\n The incident led to policy changes at Wikipedia for tightening up the verifiability of biographical articles of living people.\n\n\nWikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeated competing changes to an article, known as \"edit warring\".\n It is widely seen as a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added,\n and criticized as creating a competitive\n and conflict-based editing culture associated with traditional masculine \n.\n\n\n of the \n examined editing conflicts and their resolution in a 2013 study.\n Yasseri contended that simple reverts or \"undo\" operations were not the most significant measure of \n at Wikipedia. He relied instead on \"mutually reverting edit pairs\", where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor. The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles \n, \n, and \n.\n By comparison, for the German Wikipedia, the three largest conflict rates at the time of the study were for the articles covering \n, \n, and \n.\n\n\n\n\nContent in Wikipedia is subject to the laws (in particular, \n laws) of the United States and of the US state of \n, where the majority of Wikipedia's servers are located.\n By using the site, one agrees to the Wikimedia Foundation \n and \n; some of the main rules are that contributors are legally responsible for their edits and contributions, that they should follow the policies that govern each of the independent project editions, and they may not engage in activities, whether legal or illegal, that may be harmful to other users.\n In addition to the terms, the Foundation has developed policies, described as the \"official policies of the Wikimedia Foundation\".\n\n\nThe fundamental principles of the Wikipedia community are embodied in the \"Five pillars\", while the detailed editorial principles are expressed in numerous policies and guidelines intended to appropriately shape content.\n The five pillars are:\n\nThe rules developed by the community are stored in wiki form, and Wikipedia editors write and revise the website's policies and guidelines in accordance with community consensus.\n Editors can enforce the rules by \n or modifying non-compliant material.\n Originally, rules on the non-English editions of Wikipedia were based on a translation of the rules for the English Wikipedia. They have since diverged to some extent.\n\n\nThe two most commonly used \n across all editions of Wikipedia are: The article namespace (which are the articles of the encyclopedia) and the category namespace (which is a collection of pages such as articles). In addition, there have been various books and reading lists that are composed completely of articles and categories of a certain Wikipedia.\n\nAccording to the rules on the English Wikipedia community, each entry in Wikipedia must be about a topic that is \n and is not a dictionary entry or dictionary-style.\n A topic should also meet \n, which generally means that the topic must have been covered in mainstream media or major academic journal sources that are independent of the article's subject.\n Further, Wikipedia intends to convey only knowledge that is already established and recognized.\n It must not present original research.\n A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a reliable source, as do all quotations.\n Among Wikipedia editors, this is often phrased as \"verifiability, not truth\" to express the idea that the readers, not the encyclopedia, are ultimately responsible for checking the truthfulness of the articles and making their own interpretations.\n This can at times lead to the removal of information which, though valid, is not properly sourced.\n Finally, Wikipedia must not take sides.\n\n\nWikipedia's initial \n integrated \n and \n elements over time.\n An article is not considered to be owned by its creator or any other editor, nor by the subject of the article.\n\n\nEditors in good standing in the community can request extra \n, granting them the technical ability to perform certain special actions. In particular, editors can choose to run for \"\n\",\n which includes the ability to delete pages or prevent them from being changed in cases of severe vandalism or editorial disputes.\n Administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent disruptive editors from making unproductive edits.\n\n\nBy 2012, fewer editors were becoming administrators compared to Wikipedia's earlier years, in part because the process of vetting potential administrators had become more rigorous.\n In 2022, there was a particularly contentious request for adminship over the candidate's anti-Trump views; ultimately, they were granted adminship.\n\n\nOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semiformal dispute resolution process. To determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums, seek outside input through third opinion requests, or initiate a more general community discussion known as a \"request for comment\".\n\n\nWikipedia encourages local resolutions of conflicts, which Jemielniak argues is quite unique in organization studies, though there has been some recent interest in \n in the field.\n \n and \n argue that the approaches to consensus building are similar to those used by \n.\n A difference from Quaker meetings is the absence of a \n in the presence of disagreement, a role played by the clerk in Quaker meetings.\n\n\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted.\n Statistical analyzes suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,\n functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate.\n Therefore, the committee does not dictate the content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered biased).\n Commonly used solutions include cautions and probations (used in 63% of cases) and banning editors from articles (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%).\n Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of \n and \n.\n When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather edit warring and other violations of editing policies, solutions tend to be limited to warnings.\n\n\nEach article and each user of Wikipedia has an associated and dedicated \"talk\" page. These form the primary communication channel for editors to discuss, coordinate and debate.\n\n\nWikipedia's community has been described as \n,\n although not always with entirely negative connotations.\n Its preference for cohesiveness, even if it requires compromise that includes disregard of \n, has been referred to as \"\n\".\n\n\nWikipedia does not require that its editors and contributors provide identification.\n As Wikipedia grew, \"Who writes Wikipedia?\" became one of the questions frequently asked there.\n Jimmy Wales once argued that only \"a community ... a dedicated group of a few hundred volunteers\" makes the bulk of contributions to Wikipedia and that the project is therefore \"much like any traditional organization\".\n In 2008, a \n magazine article reported that: \"According to researchers in Palo Alto, one percent of Wikipedia users are responsible for about half of the site's edits.\"\n This method of evaluating contributions was later disputed by \n, who noted that several articles he sampled had large portions of their content (measured by number of characters) contributed by users with low edit counts.\n\n\n\n\nThe English Wikipedia has \n articles, \n registered editors, and \n active editors. An editor is considered active if they have made one or more edits in the past 30 days.\n\n\nEditors who fail to comply with Wikipedia cultural rituals, such as signing talk page comments, may implicitly signal that they are Wikipedia outsiders, increasing the odds that Wikipedia insiders may target or discount their contributions. Becoming a Wikipedia insider involves non-trivial costs: the contributor is expected to learn Wikipedia-specific technological codes, submit to a sometimes convoluted dispute resolution process, and learn a \"baffling culture rich with in-jokes and insider references\".\n Editors who do not log in are in some sense \"\n\" on Wikipedia,\n as \"participants are accredited by members of the wiki community, who have a vested interest in preserving the quality of the work product, on the basis of their ongoing participation\",\n but the contribution histories of anonymous unregistered editors recognized only by their \n cannot be attributed to a particular editor with certainty.\n\n\nA 2007 study by researchers from \n found that \"anonymous and infrequent contributors to Wikipedia ... are as reliable a source of knowledge as those contributors who register with the site\".\n Jimmy Wales stated in 2009 that \"[I]t turns out over 50% of all the edits are done by just 0.7% of the users\n... 524 people\n... And in fact, the most active 2%, which is 1400 people, have done 73.4% of all the edits.\"\n However, \n editor and journalist \n showed in 2009 that in a random sample of articles, most Wikipedia content (measured by the amount of contributed text that survives to the latest sampled edit) is created by \"outsiders\", while most editing and formatting is done by \"insiders\".\n\n\nA 2008 study found that Wikipedians were less agreeable, open, and conscientious than others,\n although a later commentary pointed out serious flaws, including that the data showed higher openness and that the differences with the control group and the samples were small.\n According to a 2009 study, there is \"evidence of growing resistance from the Wikipedia community to new content\".\n\n\nSeveral studies have shown that most Wikipedia contributors are male. Notably, the results of a Wikimedia Foundation survey in 2008 showed that only 13 percent of Wikipedia editors were female.\n Because of this, universities throughout the United States tried to encourage women to become Wikipedia contributors.\n Similarly, many of these universities, including \n and \n, gave college credit to students who create or edit an article relating to women in science or technology.\n \n, a professor and scientist, said that the reason he thought the number of male contributors outnumbered the number of females so greatly was because identifying as a woman may expose oneself to \"ugly, intimidating behavior\".\n Data has shown that Africans are underrepresented among Wikipedia editors.\n\n\n\n\nThere are currently 329 language editions of Wikipedia (also called \n, or simply \n). As of May 2024, the six largest, in order of article count, are the \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n Wikipedias.\n The second and fifth-largest Wikipedias owe their position to the article-creating bot \n, which as of 2013\n had created about half the articles on the \n, and most of the articles in the \n and \n. The latter are both languages of the Philippines.\nIn addition to the top six, twelve other Wikipedias have more than a million articles each (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n), seven more have over 500,000 articles (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n), 44 more have over 100,000, and 82 more have over 10,000.\n The largest, the English Wikipedia, has over 6.8 million articles. As of January 2021,\n the English Wikipedia receives 48% of Wikipedia's cumulative traffic, with the remaining split among the other languages. The top 10 editions represent approximately 85% of the total traffic.\nSince Wikipedia is based on the \n and therefore worldwide, contributors to the same language edition may use different dialects or may come from different countries (as is the case for the English edition). These differences may lead to some conflicts over \n (e.g. \n versus \n)\n or points of view.\n\n\nThough the various language editions are held to global policies such as \"neutral point of view\", they diverge on some points of policy and practice, most notably on whether images that are not \n may be used under a claim of \n.\n\n\nJimmy Wales has described Wikipedia as \"an effort to create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language\".\n Though each language edition functions more or less independently, some efforts are made to supervise them all. They are coordinated in part by Meta-Wiki, the Wikimedia Foundation's wiki devoted to maintaining all its projects (Wikipedia and others).\n For instance, Meta-Wiki provides important statistics on all language editions of Wikipedia,\n and it maintains a list of articles every Wikipedia should have.\n The list concerns basic content by subject: biography, history, geography, society, culture, science, technology, and mathematics.\n It is not rare for articles strongly related to a particular language not to have counterparts in another edition. For example, articles about small towns in the United States might be available only in English, even when they meet the notability criteria of other language Wikipedia projects.\n\n\nTranslated articles represent only a small portion of articles in most editions, in part because those editions do not allow fully automated translation of articles. Articles available in more than one language may offer \"interwiki links\", which link to the counterpart articles in other editions.\n\n\nA study published by \n in 2012 also estimated the share of contributions to different editions of Wikipedia from different regions of the world. It reported that the proportion of the edits made from North America was 51% for the English Wikipedia, and 25% for the \n.\n\n\nOn March 1, 2014, \n, in an article titled \"The Future of Wikipedia\", cited a trend analysis concerning data published by the Wikimedia Foundation stating that \"the number of editors for the English-language version has fallen by a third in seven years.\"\n The attrition rate for active editors in English Wikipedia was cited by \n as substantially in contrast to statistics for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia). \n reported that the number of contributors with an average of five or more edits per month was relatively constant since 2008 for Wikipedia in other languages at approximately 42,000 editors within narrow seasonal variances of about 2,000 editors up or down. The number of active editors in English Wikipedia, by sharp comparison, was cited as peaking in 2007 at approximately 50,000 and dropping to 30,000 by the start of 2014.\n\n\nIn contrast, the trend analysis for Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) shows success in retaining active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000. No comment was made concerning which of the differentiated edit policy standards from Wikipedia in other languages (non-English Wikipedia) would provide a possible alternative to English Wikipedia for effectively improving substantial editor attrition rates on the English-language Wikipedia.\n\n\nVarious \n have \n, which includes more than fifty policies and nearly 150,000 words as of 2014.\n\n\nCritics have stated that Wikipedia exhibits \n. In 2010, columnist and journalist \n described Wikipedia as being a mixture of \"truth, half-truth, and some falsehoods\".\n Articles in \n and \n have criticized Wikipedia's \"Undue Weight\" policy, concluding that Wikipedia explicitly is not designed to provide correct information about a subject, but rather focus on all the major viewpoints on the subject, give less attention to minor ones, and creates omissions that can lead to false beliefs based on incomplete information.\n\n\nJournalists \n and \n alleged (in 2010 and 2011 respectively) that articles are dominated by the loudest and most persistent voices, usually by a group with an \"ax to grind\" on the topic.\n A 2008 article in \n Journal concluded that as a resource about controversial topics, Wikipedia is subject to manipulation and \n.\n\n\nIn 2020, Omer Benjakob and Stephen Harrison noted that \"Media coverage of Wikipedia has radically shifted over the past two decades: once cast as an intellectual frivolity, it is now lauded as the 'last bastion of shared reality' online.\"\n\n\nMultiple news networks and pundits have accused Wikipedia of being \n. In February 2021, \n accused Wikipedia of whitewashing \n and \n and having too much \"\n bias\".\n Wikipedia co-founder Sanger said that Wikipedia has become a \"propaganda\" for the left-leaning \"establishment\" and warned the site can no longer be trusted.\n In 2022, libertarian \n opined that Wikipedia, a site he financially supported at one time, appeared to have gradually taken a significant turn in bias to the political left, specifically on political topics.\n Some studies highlight the fact that Wikipedia (and in particular the English Wikipedia) has a \"western cultural bias\" (or \"pro-western bias\")\n or \"Eurocentric bias\",\n reiterating, says Anna Samoilenko, \"similar biases that are found in the 'ivory tower' of academic historiography\". Due to this persistent Eurocentrism, scholars like Carwil Bjork-James\n or the authors of '\n'\n call for a \"decolonization\" of Wikipedia.\n\nArticles for traditional encyclopedias such as \n are written by experts, lending such encyclopedias a reputation for accuracy.\n However, a peer review in 2005 of forty-two scientific entries on both Wikipedia and \n by the science journal \n found few differences in accuracy, and concluded that \"the average science entry in Wikipedia contained around four inaccuracies; \n, about three.\"\n Joseph Reagle suggested that while the study reflects \"a topical strength of Wikipedia contributors\" in science articles, \"Wikipedia may not have fared so well using a random sampling of articles or on humanities subjects.\"\n Others raised similar critiques.\n The findings by \n were disputed by \n,\n and in response, \n gave a rebuttal of the points raised by \n.\n In addition to the point-for-point disagreement between these two parties, others have examined the sample size and selection method used in the \n effort, and suggested a \"flawed study design\" (in \ns manual selection of articles, in part or in whole, for comparison), absence of statistical analysis (e.g., of reported \n), and a lack of study \"statistical power\" (i.e., owing to small \n, 42 or 4\n× 10\n articles compared, vs >10\n and >10\n set sizes for \n and the English Wikipedia, respectively).\n\n\nAs a consequence of the open structure, Wikipedia \"makes no guarantee of validity\" of its content, since no one is ultimately responsible for any claims appearing in it.\n Concerns have been raised by \n in 2009 regarding the lack of \n that results from users' anonymity,\n the insertion of false information,\n \n, and similar problems.\n\nEconomist \n wrote: \"If I had to guess whether Wikipedia or the median refereed journal article on economics was more likely to be true after a not so long think I would opt for Wikipedia.\" He comments that some traditional sources of non-fiction suffer from systemic biases, and novel results, in his opinion, are over-reported in journal articles as well as relevant information being omitted from news reports. However, he also cautions that errors are frequently found on Internet sites and that academics and experts must be vigilant in correcting them.\n \n has argued that, due to the number of reviewers, \"the content of a popular Wikipedia page is actually the most reliable form of information ever created\".\n In September 2022, \n journalist Liam Mannix noted that, \"There's no reason to expect Wikipedia to be accurate... And yet it [is].\" Mannix further discussed the multiple studies that have proved Wikipedia to be generally as reliable as \n, summarizing that, \"...turning our back on such an extraordinary resource is... well, a little petty.\"\n\n\nCritics argue that Wikipedia's open nature and a lack of proper sources for most of the information makes it unreliable.\n Some commentators suggest that Wikipedia may be reliable, but that the reliability of any given article is not clear.\n Editors of traditional \n such as the \n have questioned the project's \n and status as an encyclopedia.\n Wikipedia co-founder \n has claimed that Wikipedia has largely avoided the problem of \"fake news\" because the Wikipedia community regularly debates the quality of sources in articles.\n\n\nWikipedia's open structure inherently makes it an easy target for \n, \n, and various forms of paid advocacy seen as counterproductive to the maintenance of a neutral and verifiable online encyclopedia.\n\nIn response to \n and undisclosed editing issues, Wikipedia was reported in an article in \n to have strengthened its rules and laws against undisclosed editing.\n The article stated that: \"Beginning Monday [from the date of the article, June 16, 2014], changes in Wikipedia's terms of use will require anyone paid to edit articles to disclose that arrangement. \n, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation's chief communications officer, said the changes address a sentiment among volunteer editors that, 'we're not an advertising service; we're an encyclopedia.\n\"\n These issues, among others, had been parodied since the first decade of Wikipedia, notably by \n on \n.\n\n\n (2011), cites Wikipedia as a \"general source\" that \"can be a real boon\" in \"coming up to speed in the law governing a situation\" and, \"while not authoritative, can provide basic facts as well as leads to more in-depth resources\".\n\n\nSome university \n discourage students from citing any encyclopedia in \n, preferring \n;\n some specifically prohibit Wikipedia citations.\n Wales stresses that encyclopedias of any type are not usually appropriate to use as citable sources, and should not be relied upon as authoritative.\n Wales once (2006 or earlier) said he receives about ten \n weekly from students saying they got failing grades on papers because they cited Wikipedia; he told the students they got what they deserved. \"For God's sake, you're in college; don't cite the encyclopedia\", he said.\n\n\nIn February 2007, an article in \n newspaper reported that a few of the professors at \n were including Wikipedia articles in their \n, although without realizing the articles might change.\n In June 2007, \n, former president of the \n, condemned Wikipedia, along with \n, stating that academics who endorse the use of Wikipedia are \"the intellectual equivalent of a dietitian who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything\".\n\n\nA 2020 research study published in \n argued that Wikipedia could be applied in the higher education \"\n\", an educational model where students learn before coming to class and apply it in classroom activities. The experimental group was instructed to learn before class and get immediate feedback before going in (the flipped classroom model), while the control group was given direct instructions in class (the conventional classroom model). The groups were then instructed to collaboratively develop Wikipedia entries, which would be graded in quality after the study. The results showed that the experimental group yielded more Wikipedia entries and received higher grades in quality. The study concluded that learning with Wikipedia in flipped classrooms was more effective than in conventional classrooms, demonstrating Wikipedia could be used as an educational tool in higher education.\n\n\nOn March 5, 2014, Julie Beck writing for \n magazine in an article titled \"Doctors' #1 Source for Healthcare Information: Wikipedia\", stated that \"Fifty percent of physicians look up conditions on the (Wikipedia) site, and some are editing articles themselves to improve the quality of available information.\"\n Beck continued to detail in this article new programs of \n at the \n to offer medical school courses to medical students for learning to edit and improve \n, as well as internal quality control programs within Wikipedia organized by \n to improve a group of 200 health-related articles of central medical importance up to Wikipedia's highest standard of articles using its Featured Article and Good Article peer-review evaluation process.\n In a May 7, 2014, follow-up article in \n titled \"Can Wikipedia Ever Be a Definitive Medical Text?\", Julie Beck quotes WikiProject Medicine's James Heilman as stating: \"Just because a reference is peer-reviewed doesn't mean it's a high-quality reference.\"\n Beck added that: \"Wikipedia has its own peer review process before articles can be classified as 'good' or 'featured'. Heilman, who has participated in that process before, says 'less than one percent' of Wikipedia's medical articles have passed.\"\n\n\nWikipedia seeks to create a summary of all human knowledge in the form of an online encyclopedia, with each topic covered encyclopedically in one article. Since it has \n of \n, it can have far more topics than can be covered by any printed encyclopedia.\n The exact degree and manner of coverage on Wikipedia is under constant review by its editors, and disagreements are not uncommon (see \n).\n Wikipedia contains materials that some people may find objectionable, offensive, or pornographic.\n The \"Wikipedia is not censored\" policy has sometimes proved controversial: in 2008, Wikipedia rejected an online petition against the inclusion of \n in the \n of its \n article, citing this policy.\n The presence of politically, religiously, and pornographically sensitive materials in Wikipedia has led to the \n by national authorities in China\n and Pakistan,\n amongst other countries.\n\n\nThrough its \"Wikipedia Loves Libraries\" program, Wikipedia has partnered with major public libraries such as the \n to expand its coverage of underrepresented subjects and articles.\n A 2011 study conducted by researchers at the \n indicated that male and female editors focus on different coverage topics. There was a greater concentration of females in the \"people and arts\" category, while males focus more on \"geography and science\".\n\n\nResearch conducted by Mark Graham of the \n in 2009 indicated that the geographic distribution of article topics is highly uneven, Africa being the most underrepresented.\n Across 30 language editions of Wikipedia, historical articles and sections are generally Eurocentric and focused on recent events.\n\n\nAn editorial in \n in 2014 claimed that more effort went into providing references for \n than a \n.\n Data has also shown that Africa-related material often faces omission; a knowledge gap that a July 2018 Wikimedia conference in \n sought to address.\n\n\n have consistently shown that Wikipedia systematically over-represents a point of view (POV) belonging to a particular demographic described as the \"average Wikipedian\", who is an educated, technically inclined, English speaking white male, aged 15–49 from a developed Christian country in the northern hemisphere.\n This POV is over-represented in relation to all existing POVs.\n This systemic bias in editor demographic results in cultural bias, \n, and \n.\n There are two broad types of bias, which are \n (when a topic is omitted) and \n (when a certain POV is over-represented in an article or by references).\n\n\nInterdisciplinary scholarly assessments of Wikipedia articles have found that while articles are typically accurate and free of misinformation, they are also typically incomplete and fail to present all perspectives with a neutral point of view.\n In 2011, Wales claimed that the unevenness of coverage is a reflection of the demography of the editors, citing for example \"biographies of famous women through history and issues surrounding early childcare\".\n The October 22, 2013, essay by Tom Simonite in MIT's \n titled \"The Decline of Wikipedia\" discussed the effect of systemic bias and \n on the \n.\n\n\nWikipedia has been criticized for allowing information about graphic content.\n Articles depicting what some critics have called objectionable content (such as \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n) contain graphic pictures and detailed information easily available to anyone with access to the internet, including children.\n\n\nThe site also includes \n such as images and videos of \n and \n, illustrations of \n, and photos from \n films in its articles. It also has non-sexual \n.\n\n\nThe Wikipedia article about \n—a 1976 album from the German \n band \n—features a picture of the album's original cover, which depicts a naked \n girl. The original release cover caused controversy and was replaced in some countries. In December 2008, access to the Wikipedia article \n was blocked for four days by most \n in the United Kingdom after the \n (IWF) decided the album cover was a potentially illegal indecent image and added the article's URL to a \"blacklist\" it supplies to British internet service providers.\n\n\nIn April 2010, Sanger wrote a letter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, outlining his concerns that two categories of images on \n contained child pornography, and were in violation of \n.\n Sanger later clarified that the images, which were related to \n and one about \n, were not of real children, but said that they constituted \"obscene visual representations of the sexual abuse of children\", under the \n.\n That law bans photographic child pornography and cartoon images and drawings of children that are \n.\n Sanger also expressed concerns about access to the images on Wikipedia in schools.\n \n spokesman Jay Walsh strongly rejected Sanger's accusation,\n saying that Wikipedia did not have \"material we would deem to be illegal. If we did, we would remove it.\"\n Following the complaint by Sanger, Wales deleted sexual images without consulting the community. After some editors who volunteered to maintain the site argued that the decision to delete had been made hastily, Wales voluntarily gave up some of the powers he had held up to that time as part of his co-founder status. He wrote in a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing-list that this action was \"in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted\".\n Critics, including \n, noticed that many of the pornographic images deleted from Wikipedia since 2010 have reappeared.\n\n\nOne \n concern in the case of Wikipedia is the right of a private citizen to remain a \"private citizen\" rather than a \"\n\" in the eyes of the law.\n It is a battle between the right to be anonymous in \n and the right to be anonymous in \n. The Wikimedia Foundation's \n states, \"we believe that you shouldn't have to provide personal information to participate in the free knowledge movement\", and states that \"personal information\" may be shared \"For legal reasons\", \"To Protect You, Ourselves & Others\", or \"To Understand & Experiment\".\n\n\nIn January 2006, a German court ordered the \n shut down within Germany because it stated the full name of \n, aka \"Tron\", a deceased hacker. On February 9, 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned, with the court rejecting the notion that Tron's \n or that of his parents was being violated.\n\n\nWikipedia has a \"\n\" that uses Znuny, a \n fork of \n to handle queries without having to reveal the identities of the involved parties. This is used, for example, in confirming the permission for using individual images and other media in the project.\n\n\nIn late April 2023, Wikimedia Foundation announced that Wikipedia will not submit to any age verifications that may be required by the Online Safety Bill. Rebecca MacKinnon of the Wikimedia Foundation said that such checks would run counter to the website's commitment to minimal data collection on its contributors and readers.\n\n\nWikipedia was described in 2015 as harboring a battleground culture of \n and \n.\n The perceived tolerance of abusive language was a reason put forth in 2013 for the gender gap in Wikipedia editorship.\n \n have been held to encourage female editors and increase the coverage of women's topics.\n\n\nIn May 2018, a Wikipedia editor rejected a submitted article about \n due to lack of coverage in the media.\n Five months later, Strickland won a \n \"for groundbreaking inventions in the field of laser physics\", becoming the third woman to ever receive the award.\n Prior to winning the award, Strickland's only mention on Wikipedia was in the article about her collaborator and co-winner of the award \n.\n Her exclusion from Wikipedia led to accusations of sexism, but Corinne Purtill writing for \n argued that \"it's also a pointed lesson in the hazards of gender bias in media, and of the broader consequences of underrepresentation.\"\n Purtill attributes the issue to the gender bias in media coverage.\n\n\nA comprehensive 2008 survey, published in 2016, by Julia B. Bear of \n's College of Business and Benjamin Collier of \n found significant gender differences in confidence in expertise, discomfort with editing, and response to critical feedback. \"Women reported less confidence in their expertise, expressed greater discomfort with editing (which typically involves conflict), and reported more negative responses to critical feedback compared to men.\"\n\n\nWikipedia is hosted and funded by the \n, a non-profit organization which also operates Wikipedia-related projects such as \n and \n.\n The foundation relies on public contributions and grants to fund its mission.\n The foundation's 2020 Internal Revenue Service \n shows revenue of $124.6 million and expenses of almost $112.2 million, with assets of about $191.2 million and liabilities of almost $11 million.\n\n\nIn May 2014, Wikimedia Foundation named \n as its second executive director, taking over for Sue Gardner.\n \n \n reported on May 1, 2014, that Tretikov's information technology background from her years at University of California offers Wikipedia an opportunity to develop in more concentrated directions guided by her often repeated position statement that, \"Information, like air, wants to be free.\"\n The same \n article reported these directions of development according to an interview with spokesman Jay Walsh of Wikimedia, who \"said Tretikov would address that issue (\n) as a priority. 'We are really pushing toward more transparency\n... We are reinforcing that paid advocacy is not welcome.' Initiatives to involve greater diversity of contributors, better mobile support of Wikipedia, new geo-location tools to find local content more easily, and more tools for users in the second and third world are also priorities\", Walsh said.\n\n\nFollowing the departure of Tretikov from Wikipedia due to issues concerning the use of the \"superprotection\" feature which some language versions of Wikipedia have adopted,\n \n became the third executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation in June 2016.\n Maher stated that one of her priorities would be the issue of editor harassment endemic to Wikipedia as identified by the Wikipedia board in December. She said to \n regarding the harassment issue that: \"It establishes a sense within the community that this is a priority\n... [and that correction requires that] it has to be more than words.\"\n\n\nMaher served as executive director until April 2021.\n \n was named the incoming CEO in September 2021, and took over that role in January 2022. She stated that one of her focuses would be increasing diversity in the Wikimedia community.\n\n\nWikipedia is also supported by many organizations and groups that are affiliated with the Wikimedia Foundation but independently-run, called \n. These include \n (which are national or sub-national organizations, such as Wikimedia Deutschland and Wikimedia France), thematic organizations (such as Amical Wikimedia for the \n community), and user groups. These affiliates participate in the promotion, development, and funding of Wikipedia.\n\n\nThe operation of Wikipedia depends on \n, a custom-made, \n and open source \n platform written in \n and built upon the \n database system.\n The software incorporates programming features such as a \n, \n, a \n system for \n, and \n.\n MediaWiki is licensed under the \n (GPL) and it is used by all Wikimedia projects, as well as many other wiki projects.\n Originally, Wikipedia ran on \n written in \n by Clifford Adams (Phase I), which initially required \n for article hyperlinks; the present double bracket style was incorporated later.\n Starting in January 2002 (Phase II), Wikipedia began running on a \n engine with a MySQL database; this software was custom-made for Wikipedia by \n. The Phase II software was repeatedly modified to accommodate the \n demand. In July 2002 (Phase III), Wikipedia shifted to the third-generation software, MediaWiki, originally written by \n.\n\nSeveral MediaWiki extensions are installed to extend the functionality of the MediaWiki software.\n\n\nIn April 2005, a \n extension\n was added to MediaWiki's built-in search and Wikipedia switched from MySQL to Lucene for searching. Lucene was later replaced by CirrusSearch which is based on \n.\n\n\nIn July 2013, after extensive beta testing, a \n (What You See Is What You Get) extension, \n, was opened to public use.\n It was met with much rejection and criticism, and was described as \"slow and buggy\".\n The feature was changed from opt-out to opt-in afterward.\n\n\nComputer programs called \n have often been used to perform simple and repetitive tasks, such as correcting common misspellings and stylistic issues, or to start articles such as geography entries in a standard format from statistical data.\n One controversial contributor, \n, created articles with his bot \n, which was reported to create up to 10,000 articles on the Swedish Wikipedia on certain days.\n Additionally, there are bots designed to automatically notify editors when they make common editing errors (such as unmatched quotes or unmatched parentheses).\n Edits falsely identified by bots as the work of a banned editor can be restored by other editors. An anti-vandal bot is programmed to detect and revert vandalism quickly.\n Bots are able to indicate edits from particular accounts or \n ranges, as occurred at the time of the shooting down of the \n in July 2014 when it was reported that edits were made via IPs controlled by the Russian government.\n Bots on Wikipedia must be approved before activation.\n\n\nAccording to \n, the current expansion of Wikipedia to millions of articles would be difficult to envision without the use of such bots.\n\n\nAs of 2021,\n page requests are first passed to a front-end layer of \n caching servers and back-end layer \n is done by \n.\n Requests that cannot be served from the Varnish cache are sent to load-balancing servers running the \n software, which in turn pass them to one of the Apache web servers for page rendering from the database.\n The web servers deliver pages as requested, performing page rendering for all the language editions of Wikipedia. To increase speed further, rendered pages are cached in a distributed memory cache until invalidated, allowing page rendering to be skipped entirely for most common page accesses.\n\n\nWikipedia currently runs on dedicated \n of \n servers running the \n operating system.\n As of February 2023,\n caching clusters are located in \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n By January 22, 2013, Wikipedia had migrated its primary data center to an \n facility in \n.\n In 2017, Wikipedia installed a caching cluster in an Equinix facility in \n, the first of its kind in Asia.\n In 2022, a caching data center was opened in \n, \n.\n\n\nFollowing growing amounts of incoming donations in 2013 exceeding seven digits,\n the Foundation has reached a threshold of assets which qualify its consideration under the principles of \n economics to indicate the need for the re-investment of donations into the internal research and development of the Foundation.\n Two projects of such internal research and development have been the creation of a Visual Editor and the \"Thank\" tab in the edit history, which were developed to improve issues of editor attrition.\n The estimates for reinvestment by industrial organizations into internal research and development was studied by \n, who recorded that the range of 4% to 25% annually was to be recommended, with high-end technology requiring the higher level of support for internal reinvestment.\n At the 2013 level of contributions for Wikimedia presently documented as 45 million dollars,\n the computed budget level recommended by Jaffe for reinvestment into internal research and development is between 1.8 million and 11.3 million dollars annually.\n In 2019, the level of contributions were reported by the Wikimedia Foundation as being at $120 million annually,\n updating the Jaffe estimates for the higher level of support to between $3.08 million and $19.2 million annually.\n\n\nMultiple Wikimedia projects have internal news publications. \n online newspaper \n was founded in 2005 by Michael Snow, a Wikipedia administrator who would join the Wikimedia Foundation's board of trustees in 2008.\n The publication covers news and events from the English Wikipedia, the Wikimedia Foundation, and \n.\n\n\nThe Wikipedia Library is a resource for Wikipedia editors which provides free access to a wide range of \n, so that they can consult and cite these while editing the encyclopedia.\n Over 60 publishers have partnered with The Wikipedia Library to provide access to their resources: when \n joined in 2020, a spokesman said \"By enabling free access to our content for Wikipedia editors, we hope to further the research community's resources – creating and updating Wikipedia entries on civil engineering which are read by thousands of monthly readers.\"\n\n\nWhen the project was started in 2001, all text in Wikipedia was covered by the \n (GFDL), a \n license permitting the redistribution, creation of derivative works, and commercial use of content while authors retain copyright of their work.\n The GFDL was created for software manuals that come with \n programs licensed under the \n. This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text.\n In December 2002, the \n was released; it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.\n Because the GFDL and Creative Commons were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the \n (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to relicense its content to CC BY-SA by August 1, 2009.\n In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.\n\n\nThe handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under \n doctrine,\n while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in \n). Media files covered by \n licenses (e.g. \n' \n) are shared across language editions via \n repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.\n Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.\n\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content on Wikipedia or its related projects but merely a hosting service for contributors to and licensors of Wikipedia, a position which was successfully defended in 2004 in a court in France.\n\n\nBecause Wikipedia content is distributed under an open license, anyone can reuse or re-distribute it at no charge.\n The content of Wikipedia has been published in many forms, both online and offline, outside the Wikipedia website.\n\nThousands of \"\n\" exist that republish content from Wikipedia; two prominent ones that also include content from other reference sources are \n and \n.\n Another example is \n, which began to display Wikipedia content in a mobile-device-friendly format before Wikipedia itself did.\n Some web \n make special use of Wikipedia content when displaying search results: examples include \n (via technology gained from \n)\n and \n.\n\nCollections of Wikipedia articles have been published on \n. An English version released in 2006 contained about 2,000 articles.\n The Polish-language version from 2006 contains nearly 240,000 articles,\n the German-language version from 2007/2008 contains over 620,000 articles,\n and the Spanish-language version from 2011 contains 886,000 articles.\n Additionally, \"Wikipedia for Schools\", the Wikipedia series of CDs / DVDs produced by Wikipedia and \n, is a free selection from Wikipedia designed for education towards children eight to seventeen.\n\n\nThere have been efforts to put a select subset of Wikipedia's articles into printed book form.\n Since 2009, tens of thousands of \n books that reproduced English, German, Russian, and French Wikipedia articles have been produced by the American company \n and by three \n subsidiaries of the German publisher \n.\n\n\nThe website \n, begun in 2007, extracts data from the infoboxes and category declarations of the English-language Wikipedia.\n Wikimedia has created the \n project with a similar objective of storing the basic facts from each page of Wikipedia and other Wikimedia Foundation projects and make it available in a queryable \n format, \n.\n As of February 2023,\n it has over 101 million items.\n \n is a dedicated reader device that contains an offline copy of Wikipedia, which was launched by \n and first released in 2009.\n\n\nObtaining the full contents of Wikipedia for reuse presents challenges, since direct cloning via a \n is discouraged.\n Wikipedia publishes \"\n\" of its contents, but these are text-only; as of 2023,\n there is no dump available of Wikipedia's images.\n \n is a for-profit solution to this.\n\n\nSeveral languages of Wikipedia also maintain a reference desk, where volunteers answer questions from the general public. According to a study by Pnina Shachaf in the \n, the quality of the Wikipedia reference desk is comparable to a standard library \n, with an accuracy of 55 percent.\n\n\nWikipedia's original medium was for users to read and edit content using any standard \n through a fixed \n. Although Wikipedia content has been accessible through the \n since July 2013, \n on February 9, 2014, quoted \n, deputy director of the Wikimedia Foundation, stating that the transition of internet traffic from desktops to mobile devices was significant and a cause for concern and worry. The article in \n reported the comparison statistics for mobile edits stating that, \"Only 20 percent of the readership of the English-language Wikipedia comes via mobile devices, a figure substantially lower than the percentage of mobile traffic for other media sites, many of which approach 50 percent. And the shift to mobile editing has lagged even more.\" In 2014 \n reported that Möller has assigned \"a team of 10 software developers focused on mobile\", out of a total of approximately 200 employees working at the Wikimedia Foundation. One principal concern cited by \n for the \"worry\" is for Wikipedia to effectively address attrition issues with the number of editors which the online encyclopedia attracts to edit and maintain its content in a mobile access environment.\n By 2023, the Wikimedia Foundation's staff had grown to over 700 employees.\n\n\n reported in July 2014 that Google's Android mobile apps have dominated the largest share of global smartphone shipments for 2013, with 78.6% of market share over their next closest competitor in iOS with 15.2% of the market.\n At the time of the appointment of new Wikimedia Foundation executive Lila Tretikov, Wikimedia representatives made a technical announcement concerning the number of mobile access systems in the market seeking access to Wikipedia. Soon after, the representatives stated that Wikimedia would be applying an all-inclusive approach to accommodate as many mobile access systems as possible in its efforts for expanding general mobile access, including \n and the \n system, making market share a secondary issue.\n The Android app for Wikipedia was released on July 23, 2014, to over 500,000 installs and generally positive reviews, scoring over four of a possible five in a poll of approximately 200,000 users downloading from Google.\n The version for iOS was released on April 3, 2013, to similar reviews.\n\n\nAccess to Wikipedia from mobile phones was possible as early as 2004, through the \n (WAP), via the \n service.\n In June 2007, Wikipedia launched en.mobile.wikipedia.org, an official website for wireless devices. In 2009, a newer mobile service was officially released, located at en.m.wikipedia.org, which caters to more advanced mobile devices such as the \n, \n-based devices, or \n-based devices.\n Several other methods of mobile access to Wikipedia have emerged since. Many devices and applications optimize or enhance the display of Wikipedia content for mobile devices, while some also incorporate additional features such as use of Wikipedia \n like \n.\n\n\n was an initiative of the Wikimedia Foundation to expand the reach of the encyclopedia to the developing countries by partnering with mobile operators to allow free access.\n It was discontinued in February 2018 due to lack of participation from mobile operators.\n\n\n and \n both maintain editing Wikipedia with \n is difficult and this discourages new potential contributors.\n Lih states that the number of Wikipedia editors has been declining after several years,\n and Tom Simonite of \n claims the bureaucratic structure and rules are a factor in this. Simonite alleges some \n use the labyrinthine rules and guidelines to dominate others and those editors have a vested interest in keeping the \n.\n Lih alleges there is a serious disagreement among existing contributors on how to resolve this. Lih fears for Wikipedia's long-term future while Brown fears problems with Wikipedia will remain and rival encyclopedias will not replace it.\n\n\nAccess to the \n has been \n in \n since May 2015.\n This was done after Wikipedia started to use \n encryption, which made selective censorship more difficult.\n\n\nRussians have developed clones called \n and \n.\n\nIranians have created a new website called wikisa.org.\n\n\nIn 2017–18, after a barrage of false news reports, both Facebook and YouTube announced they would rely on Wikipedia to help their users evaluate reports and reject false news.\n \n, writing in \n states, \"YouTube's reliance on Wikipedia to set the record straight builds on the thinking of another fact-challenged platform, the Facebook social network, which announced last year that Wikipedia would help its users root out '\n'.\"\n\n\nIn February 2014, \n reported that Wikipedia was ranked fifth globally among all websites, stating \"With 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors a month,\n... Wikipedia trails just Yahoo, Facebook, Microsoft and Google, the largest with 1.2 billion unique visitors.\"\n However, its ranking dropped to 13th globally by June 2020 due mostly to a rise in popularity of Chinese websites for online shopping.\n The website has since recovered its ranking as of April 2022.\n\n\nIn addition to \n in the number of its articles,\n Wikipedia has steadily gained status as a general reference website since its inception in 2001.\n The number of readers of Wikipedia worldwide reached 365 million at the end of 2009.\n The \n Internet and American Life project found that one third of US Internet users consulted Wikipedia.\n In 2011, \n gave Wikipedia a valuation of $4 billion if it ran advertisements.\n\n\nAccording to \"Wikipedia Readership Survey 2011\", the average age of Wikipedia readers is 36, with a rough parity between genders. Almost half of Wikipedia readers visit the site more than five times a month, and a similar number of readers specifically look for Wikipedia in search engine results. About 47 percent of Wikipedia readers do not realize that Wikipedia is a non-profit organization.\n\n\nAs of February 2023,\n Wikipedia attracts around 2 billion unique devices monthly, with the English Wikipedia receiving 10 billion \n each month.\n\n\nDuring the \n, Wikipedia's coverage of the pandemic and fight against misinformation received international media attention, and brought an increase in Wikipedia readership overall.\n Noam Cohen wrote in \n that Wikipedia's effort to combat \n was different from other major websites, opining, \"Unless \n, \n and \n can learn to address misinformation more effectively, Wikipedia will remain the last best place on the Internet.\"\n In October 2020, the \n announced they were freely licensing its \n and other materials on Wikimedia projects.\n There were nearly 7,000 COVID-19 related Wikipedia articles across 188 different Wikipedias, as of November 2021.\n\n\nWikipedia's content has also been used in academic studies, books, conferences, and court cases.\n The \n's website refers to Wikipedia's article on \n in the \"related links\" section of its \"further reading\" list for the \n.\n The encyclopedia's assertions are increasingly used as a source by organizations such as the US federal courts and the \n—though mainly for supporting information rather than information decisive to a case.\n Content appearing on Wikipedia has also been cited as a source and referenced in some \n reports.\n In December 2008, the scientific journal \n launched a new section for descriptions of families of RNA molecules and requires authors who contribute to the section to also submit a draft article on the \n for publication in Wikipedia.\n\n\nWikipedia has also been used as a source in journalism,\n often without attribution, and several reporters have been dismissed for \n.\n\n\nIn 2006, \n magazine recognized Wikipedia's participation (along with \n, \n, \n, and \n) in the rapid growth of online collaboration and interaction by millions of people worldwide.\n On September 16, 2007, \n reported that Wikipedia had become a focal point in the \n, saying: \"Type a candidate's name into Google, and among the first results is a Wikipedia page, making those entries arguably as important as any ad in defining a candidate. Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\"\n An October 2007 \n article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.\n\n\nOne of the first times Wikipedia was involved in a governmental affair was on September 28, 2007, when \n politician \n raised a parliamentary question with the minister of cultural resources and activities about the necessity of \n. He said that the lack of such freedom forced Wikipedia, \"the seventh most consulted website\", to forbid all images of modern Italian buildings and art, and claimed this was hugely damaging to tourist revenues.\n\n\nA working group led by \n (formed as a part of the \n-based project \n) in its report called Wikipedia \"the best-known example of crowdsourcing\n... that far exceeds traditionally-compiled information sources, such as encyclopedias and dictionaries, in scale and depth\".\n\n\nIn a 2017 opinion piece for \n, \n describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the \n and \n\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with \n and \n, the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the \n tradition of \n triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a \n culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \"\n\" (\n), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"\n\n\nWikipedia has won many awards, receiving its first two major awards in May 2004.\n The first was a Golden Nica for Digital Communities of the annual \n contest; this came with a €10,000 (£6,588; $12,700) grant and an invitation to present at the PAE Cyberarts Festival in Austria later that year. The second was a Judges' \n for the \"community\" category.\n\n\nIn 2007, readers of brandchannel.com voted Wikipedia as the fourth-highest brand ranking, receiving 15 percent of the votes in answer to the question \"Which brand had the most impact on our lives in 2006?\"\n\n\nIn September 2008, Wikipedia received \n \n award of Werkstatt Deutschland along with \n, \n, and \n. The award was presented to Wales by \n.\n\n\nIn 2015, Wikipedia was awarded both the annual \n, which recognizes exceptional contributions to culture, society or social sciences,\n and the Spanish \n on International Cooperation.\n Speaking at the Asturian Parliament in Oviedo, the city that hosts the awards ceremony, \n praised the work of the \n users.\n\n\nMany parodies target Wikipedia's openness and susceptibility to inserted inaccuracies, with characters vandalizing or modifying the online encyclopedia project's articles.\n\nComedian \n has parodied or referenced Wikipedia on numerous episodes of his show \n and coined the related term \n, meaning \"together we can create a reality that we all agree on—the reality we just agreed on\".\n Another example can be found in \"Wikipedia Celebrates 750 Years of American Independence\", a July 2006 front-page article in \n,\n as well as the 2010 \n article \n'L.A. Law' Wikipedia Page Viewed 874 Times Today\".\n\n\nIn an April 2007 episode of the American television comedy \n, office manager (\n) is shown relying on a hypothetical Wikipedia article for information on \n tactics to assist him in negotiating lesser pay for an employee.\n Viewers of the show tried to add the episode's mention of the page as a section of the actual Wikipedia article on negotiation, but this effort was prevented by other users on the article's talk page.\n\n\n\"\n\", a 2007 episode of the television show \n, played on the perception that Wikipedia is an unreliable reference tool with a scene in which \n reacts to a patient who says that a Wikipedia article indicates that the \n reverses the effects of \n by retorting that the same editor who wrote that article also wrote the \n.\n\n\nIn 2008, the comedy website \n produced a video sketch named \"Professor Wikipedia\", in which the fictitious Professor Wikipedia instructs a class with a medley of unverifiable and occasionally absurd statements.\n\n\nThe \n comic strip from May 8, 2009, features a character supporting an improbable claim by saying \"Give me ten minutes and then check Wikipedia.\"\n\n\nIn July 2009, \n broadcast a comedy series called \n, which was set on a website which was a parody of Wikipedia.\n Some of the sketches were directly inspired by Wikipedia and its articles.\n\n\nOn August 23, 2013, the \n website published a cartoon with this caption: \"Dammit, Manning, have you considered the pronoun war that this is going to start on your Wikipedia page?\"\n The cartoon referred to \n (born Bradley Edward Manning), an American \n, \n, and former United States Army soldier who had recently \n as a \n.\n\n\nIn December 2015, \n stated, in a letter published in \n newspaper, that as a historian he resorted to Wikipedia \"at least a dozen times a day\", and had never yet caught it out. He described it as \"a work of reference as useful as any in existence\", with so wide a range that it is almost impossible to find a person, place, or thing that it has left uncovered and that he could never have written his last two books without it.\n\n\nWikipedia has spawned several sister projects, which are also wikis run by the \n. These other \n include \n, a dictionary project launched in December 2002,\n \n, a collection of quotations created a week after Wikimedia launched,\n \n, a collection of collaboratively written free textbooks and annotated texts,\n \n, a site devoted to free-knowledge multimedia,\n \n, for collaborative journalism,\n and \n, a project for the creation of free learning materials and the provision of online learning activities.\n Another sister project of Wikipedia, \n, is a catalog of all species, but is not open for public editing.\n In 2012, \n, an editable travel guide,\n and \n, an editable knowledge base, launched.\n\n\nThe most obvious economic effect of Wikipedia has been the death of commercial encyclopedias, especially printed versions like \n, which were unable to compete with a product that is essentially free.\n \n's 2005 essay \"The amorality of \n\" criticizes websites with \n (like Wikipedia) for possibly leading to professional (and, in his view, superior) content producers' going out of business, because \"free trumps quality all the time\". Carr wrote, \"Implicit in the ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the \n of the amateur. I for one can't imagine anything more frightening.\"\n Others dispute the notion that Wikipedia, or similar efforts, will entirely displace traditional publications. \n, the former editor-in-chief of \n, wrote in \n that the \"\n\" approach of Wikipedia will not displace top \n with rigorous \n processes.\n\n\nWikipedia's influence on the biography publishing business has been a concern for some. Book publishing data tracker Nielsen \n stated in 2013 that biography sales were dropping \"far more sharply\".\n \n, professor of \n at the \n and author of two biographies wrote, \"The worry is that, if you can get all that information from Wikipedia, what's left for biography?\"\n\n\nWikipedia has been widely used as a \n for linguistic research in \n, \n and \n.\n In particular, it commonly serves as a target knowledge base for the \n problem, which is then called \"wikification\",\n and to the related problem of \n.\n Methods similar to wikification can in turn be used to find \"missing\" links in Wikipedia.\n\n\nIn 2015, French researchers José Lages of the \n in \n and Dima Shepelyansky of \n in \n published a global university ranking based on Wikipedia scholarly citations.\n They used \n, \n and similar algorithms \"followed by the number of appearances in the 24 different language editions of Wikipedia (descending order) and the century in which they were founded (ascending order)\".\n The study was updated in 2019.\n\n\nA 2017 \n study suggests that words used on Wikipedia articles end up in scientific publications.\n\n\nStudies related to Wikipedia have been using \n and \n to support various operations. One of the most important areas is the automatic detection of vandalism\n and \n assessment in Wikipedia.\n\n\nIn February 2022, \n from the UK's \n were found to have used Wikipedia for research in the drafting of the \n after journalists at \n noted that parts of the \n had been lifted directly from Wikipedia articles on \n and the \n.\n\n\nSeveral interactive multimedia encyclopedias incorporating entries written by the public existed long before Wikipedia was founded. The first of these was the 1986 \n, which included text (entered on \n computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.\n\n\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. \n),\n with many later being merged into the project (e.g. \n).\n One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was \n, which was created by \n in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n\n\nSubsequent collaborative \n websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Others use more traditional \n, such as \n and the online wiki encyclopedias \n and \n.\n The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.\n\n"},
{"title": "Free content - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n, \n, \n, or \n is any kind of functional work, \n, or other creative \n that meets the definition of a \n, meaning \"works or expressions which can be freely studied, applied, copied and/or modified, by anyone, for any purpose.\"\n Free content encompasses all works in the public domain and also those \n works whose \n honor and uphold the definition of free cultural work.\n\nIn most countries, the \n grants copyright holders \n over their creations by default, therefore, copyrighted content must be explicitly declared free. This is usually accomplished by referencing or including licensing statements from within the work.\n\nA \n is, according to the \n, one that has no significant legal restriction on people's freedom to:\n\nAlthough there are a great many different definitions in regular everyday use, free content is legally very similar to \n. An analogy is a use of the rival terms free software and open-source, which describe ideological differences rather than legal ones.\n The term Open Source, by contrast, sought to encompass them all in one movement.\n For instance, the \n's \n describes \"open\" as synonymous with the definition of \n in the \"Definition of Free Cultural Works\" (as also in the \n and \n).\n For such free/open content both movements recommend the same three \n, the CC BY, CC BY-SA, and CC0.\n\n\nCopyright is a legal concept, which gives the author or creator of a work legal control over the \n and public performance of their work. In many jurisdictions, this is limited by a time period after which the works then enter the \n. Copyright laws are a balance between the rights of creators of intellectual and artistic works and the rights of others to build upon those works. During the time period of copyright the author's work may only be copied, modified, or publicly performed with the consent of the author, unless the use is a \n. Traditional copyright control limits the use of the work of the author to those who either pay royalties to the author for usage of the author's content or limit their use to fair use. Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.\n Finally, it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as \n and collaborative content.\n\n\nThe public domain is a range of creative works whose \n has expired or was never established, as well as ideas and facts\n which are ineligible for copyright. A public domain work is a work whose author has either relinquished to the public or no longer can claim control over, the distribution and usage of the work. As such, any person may manipulate, distribute, or otherwise use the work, without legal ramifications. A work in the public domain or released under a \n may be referred to as \"copycenter\".\n\n\nCopyleft is a play on the word copyright and describes the practice of using copyright law to remove restrictions on distributing copies and modified versions of a work.\n The aim of copyleft is to use the legal framework of copyright to enable non-author parties to be able to reuse and, in many licensing schemes, modify content that is created by an author. Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however, the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work. Copyleft licenses require that any \n be distributed under the same terms and that the original copyright notices be maintained. A symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the \n, facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right. Unlike the copyright symbol, the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning.\n\n\nProjects that provide free content exist in several areas of interest, such as software, academic literature, general literature, music, images, video, and \n. Technology has reduced the cost of publication and reduced the entry barrier sufficiently to allow for the production of widely disseminated materials by individuals or small groups. Projects to provide free literature and multimedia content have become increasingly prominent owing to the ease of dissemination of materials that are associated with the development of computer technology. Such dissemination may have been too costly prior to these technological developments.\n\nIn media, which includes textual, audio, and visual content, free licensing schemes such as some of the licenses made by \n have allowed for the dissemination of works under a clear set of legal permissions. Not all Creative Commons licenses are entirely free; their permissions may range from very liberal general redistribution and modification of the work to a more restrictive redistribution-only licensing. Since February 2008, Creative Commons licenses which are entirely free carry a badge indicating that they are \"approved for free cultural works\".\n \n exist which exclusively feature free material and provide content such as photographs, \n, music,\n and literature.\n While extensive reuse of free content from one website in another website is legal, it is usually not sensible because of the \n problem. \n is amongst the most well-known databases of user-uploaded free content on the web. While the vast majority of content on Wikipedia is free content, some copyrighted material is hosted under \n.\n\n, which is often referred to as \n and \n, is a maturing technology with companies using them to provide services and technology to both end-users and technical consumers. The ease of dissemination increases modularity, which allows for smaller groups to contribute to projects as well as simplifying collaboration. Some claim that open source development models offer similar peer-recognition and collaborative benefit incentive as in more classical fields such as scientific research, with the social structures that result leading to decreased production costs.\n\n\nGiven sufficient interest in a software component, by using \n distribution methods, distribution costs may be reduced, easing the burden of infrastructure maintenance on developers. As distribution is simultaneously provided by consumers, these software distribution models are scalable; that is, the method is feasible regardless of the number of consumers. In some cases, free software vendors may use peer-to-peer technology as a method of dissemination.\n Project hosting and code distribution is not a problem for most free projects as \n offer these services free of charge.\n\nFree content principles have been translated into fields such as engineering, where designs and engineering knowledge can be readily shared and duplicated, in order to reduce overheads associated with project development. \n principles can be applied in engineering and technological applications, with projects in \n, small-scale manufacture,\n the automotive industry,\n and even agricultural areas. Technologies such as distributed manufacturing can allow \n and \n techniques to be able to develop small-scale production of components for the development of new, or repair of existing, devices. Rapid fabrication technologies underpin these developments, which allow end-users of technology to be able to construct devices from pre-existing blueprints, using software and manufacturing hardware to convert information into physical objects.\n\nIn academic work, the majority of works are not free, although the percentage of works that are open access is growing. \n refers to online \n outputs that are free of all restrictions to access and free of many restrictions on use (e.g. certain copyright and license restrictions).\n Authors may see open access publishing as a way of expanding the audience that is able to access their work to allow for greater impact, or support it for ideological reasons.\n Open access publishers such as \n and \n provide capacity for review and publishing of free works; such publications are currently more common in science than humanities. Various funding institutions and governing research bodies have \n that academics must produce their works to be open-access, in order to qualify for funding, such as the US \n, \n (effective 2016) and the \n (effective 2020).\n \n\nAt an institutional level, some universities, such as the \n, have adopted open access publishing by default by introducing their own mandates.\n Some mandates may permit delayed publication and may charge researchers for open access publishing.\n For teaching purposes, some universities, including \n, provide freely available course content, such as lecture notes, video resources and tutorials. This content is distributed via Internet to the general public. Publication of such resources may be either by a formal institution-wide program,\n or  informally, by individual academics or departments.\n\n publication has been seen as a method of reducing costs associated with information retrieval in research, as universities typically pay to subscribe for access to content that is published through traditional means.\n Subscriptions for non-free content journals may be expensive for universities to purchase, though the articles are written and peer-reviewed by academics themselves at no cost to the publisher. This has led to disputes between publishers and some universities over subscription costs, such as the one which occurred between the \n.\n\n\nAny country has its own law and legal system, sustained by its legislation, a set of law-documents—documents containing statutory \n, usually \n and created by \n. In a \n, each law-document is published as open media content, is in principle free content; but in general, there are no explicit licenses attributed for each law-document, so the license must be interpreted, an \n. Only a few countries have explicit licenses in their law-documents, as the UK's \n (a \n compatible license). In the other countries, the \n comes from its proper rules (general laws and rules about copyright in government works). The automatic protection provided by the \n does not apply to law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection. It is also possible to \"inherit\" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories. Examples of law-document open repositories: \n, \n, \n. In general, a law-document is offered in more than one (open) official version, but the main one is that published by a \n. So, law-documents can eventually inherit license expressed by the repository or by the gazette that contains it.\n\n describes any \n that others can copy or modify freely by \n to the original creator, but \n. This has been applied to a range of formats, including \n, \n, \n and \n. The term was an expansion of the related concept of \n.\n Such \n is said to be under an \n.\n\nThe website of the Open Content Project once defined open content as 'freely available for modification, use and redistribution under a license similar to those used by the open-source / free software community'.\n However, such a definition would exclude the Open Content License because that license forbids charging for content; a right required by free and open-source software licenses.\n\n\nThe term since shifted in meaning. Open content is \"licensed in a manner that provides users with free and perpetual permission to engage in the 5R activities.\"\n\n\nThe 5Rs are put forward on the Open Content Project website as a framework for assessing the extent to which content is open:\n\nThis broader definition distinguishes open content from open-source software, since the latter must be available for commercial use by the public. However, it is similar to several definitions for open educational resources, which include resources under noncommercial and verbatim licenses.\n\n\nThe \n of applying free software licenses to content was introduced by Michael Stutz, who in 1997 wrote the paper \"Applying Copyleft to Non-Software Information\" for the \n.\n The term \"open content\" was coined by \n in 1998 and evangelized via the \n, describing works licensed under the \n (a non-free share-alike license, see 'Free content' below) and other works licensed under similar terms.\n\n\nIt has since come to describe a broader class of content without conventional copyright restrictions. The \n of content can be assessed under the '5Rs Framework' based on the extent to which it can be reused, revised, remixed and redistributed by members of the public without violating copyright law.\n Unlike free content and content under \n, there is no clear threshold that a work must reach to qualify as 'open content'.\n\nAlthough open content has been described as a counterbalance to \n, open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, as \n which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.\n\n\nIn 2003, David Wiley announced that the Open Content Project had been succeeded by Creative Commons and their licenses; Wiley joined as \"Director of Educational Licenses\".\n\n\nIn 2005, the Open Icecat project was launched, in which product information for e-commerce applications was created and published under the Open Content License. It was embraced by the tech sector, which was already quite \n minded.\n\nIn 2006, a Creative Commons' successor project, the \n, was introduced for free content.\n It was put forth by \n, \n, \n, \n, Angela Beesley, and others.\n  The \n is used by the \n.\n In 2009, the Attribution and Attribution-ShareAlike Creative Commons licenses were marked as \"Approved for Free Cultural Works\".\n\n\nAnother successor project is the \n, founded by \n in \n, in 2004\n as a global non-profit network to promote and share open content and data.\n  \n\nIn 2007 the \n gave an \n for \"content such as music, films, books; data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise; government and other administrative information\".\n In October 2014 with version 2.0 \n and \n were defined and \"open\" is described as synonymous to the definitions of open/free in the Open Source Definition, the Free Software Definition, and the Definition of Free Cultural Works.\n \n\nA distinct difference is the focus given to the public domain, \n, and readable \n. OKF recommends six conformant licenses: three of OKN's (Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence, Open Data Commons Attribution License, Open Data Commons \n) and the \n, \n, and \n Creative Commons licenses.\n\n\n\"\n\" refers to toll-free or \n access to content, mainly published in \n scholarly journals. Some open access works are also licensed for reuse and redistribution (libre open access), which would qualify them as open content.\n\nThe later \n by the Open Knowledge Foundation defines \n with open content and \n as sub-elements and draws heavily on the Open Source Definition; it preserves the limited sense of open content as free content,\n unifying both.\n\nOpen content has been used to develop alternative routes towards higher education. Traditional universities are expensive, and their tuition rates are increasing.\n Open content is a free way of obtaining higher education that is \"focused on collective knowledge and the sharing and reuse of learning and scholarly content.\"\n There are multiple projects and organizations that promote learning through open content, including \n and \n. Some universities, like \n, \n, and \n are making their courses freely available on the internet.\n\n\nTraditional textbooks, aside from being expensive, can be inconvenient and out of date, because of publishers' tendency to print new editions.\n Open textbooks help to eliminate this problem, because they are online and thus easily updatable. There are multiple organizations promoting the creation of openly licensed textbooks such as the \n Open Textbook Library, \n, \n, the Saylor Academy, Open Textbook Challenge, and \n.\n\nAccording to the current definition of open content on the OpenContent website, any general, royalty-free copyright license would qualify as an open license because it 'provides users with the right to make more kinds of uses than those normally permitted under the law. These permissions are granted to users free of charge.'\n\n\nHowever, the narrower definition used in the Open Definition effectively limits open content to libre content. Any free content license, defined by the Definition of Free Cultural Works, would qualify as an open content license. According to this narrower criteria, the following still-maintained licenses qualify:\n"},
{"title": "Encyclopedia - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\nAn \n (\n) or \n (\n)\n is a \n or \n providing summaries of \n, either general or special, to a particular field or discipline.\n Encyclopedias are divided into \n or entries that are arranged \n by article name\n or by thematic categories, or else are \n and searchable.\n Encyclopedia entries are longer and more detailed than those in most \n.\n Generally speaking, encyclopedia articles focus on \n concerning the subject named in the article's title;\n this is unlike dictionary entries, which focus on \n information about \n, such as their \n, meaning, \n, use, and \n forms.\n\n\nEncyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years and have evolved considerably during that time as regards language (written in a major international or a vernacular language), size (few or many volumes), intent (presentation of a global or a limited range of knowledge), cultural perspective (authoritative, ideological, didactic, utilitarian), authorship (qualifications, style), readership (education level, background, interests, capabilities), and the technologies available for their production and distribution (hand-written manuscripts, small or large print runs, Internet). As a valued source of reliable information compiled by experts, printed versions found a prominent place in \n, \n and other educational institutions.\n\nThe appearance of \n in the 21st century, such as \n, has vastly expanded the accessibility, authorship, readership, and variety of encyclopedia entries.\n\n\nIndeed, the purpose of an encyclopedia is to collect knowledge disseminated around the globe; to set forth its general system to the men with whom we live, and transmit it to those who will come after us, so that the work of preceding centuries will not become useless to the centuries to come; and so that our offspring, becoming better instructed, will at the same time become more virtuous and happy, and that we should not die without having rendered a service to the human race in the future years to come.\n\nThe word \n (\n|\n) comes from the \n \n,\n \n \n, meaning 'general education' from \n (\n), meaning 'circular, recurrent, required regularly, general'\n and \n (\n), meaning 'education, rearing of a child'; together, the phrase literally translates as 'complete instruction' or 'complete knowledge'.\n However, the two separate words were reduced to a single word due to a scribal error\n by copyists of a \n manuscript edition of \n in 1470.\n The copyists took this phrase to be a single Greek word, \n, with the same meaning, and this spurious Greek word became the \n word \n, which in turn came into English. Because of this compounded word, fifteenth-century readers since have often, and incorrectly, thought that the Roman authors Quintillian and \n described an ancient genre.\n\n\nThe modern encyclopedia evolved from the \n in the 18th century; this lineage can be seen in the alphabetical order of print encyclopedias.\n Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been compiled by well-educated, well-informed content \n, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work that primarily focuses on an alphabetical listing of \n and their \n. \n words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited \n, \n or background for the word defined. While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in \n the meaning, significance or limitations of a \n, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge.\n\nTo address those needs, an encyclopedia article is typically not limited to simple definitions, and is not limited to defining an individual word, but provides a more extensive meaning for a \n. In addition to defining and listing synonymous terms for the topic, the article can treat the topic's more extensive meaning in more depth and convey the most relevant accumulated knowledge on that subject. An encyclopedia article also often includes many \n and \n, as well as \n and \n.\n An encyclopedia is, theoretically, not written to convince, although one of its goals is indeed to convince its reader of its veracity.\n\nWikipedia co-founder \n has said that the goal of an encyclopedia should be to provide \"the sum of all human knowledge, but sum meaning summary.\"\n\n\nIn addition, sometimes books or reading lists are compiled from a compendium of articles (either wholly or partially taken) from a specific encyclopedia.\n\nFour major elements define an encyclopedia: its subject matter, its scope, its method of organization, and its method of production:\n\nSome works entitled \"dictionaries\" are similar to encyclopedias, especially those concerned with a particular field (such as the \n, the \n, and \n). The \n Australia's national dictionary, became an \n after its first edition in recognition of the use of proper nouns in common communication, and the words derived from such proper nouns.\n\nThere are some broad differences between encyclopedias and dictionaries. Most noticeably, encyclopedia articles are longer, fuller and more thorough than entries in most general-purpose dictionaries.\n There are differences in content as well. Generally speaking, dictionaries provide \n information about words themselves, while encyclopedias focus more on the things for which those words stand.\n Thus, while dictionary entries are inextricably fixed to the word described, encyclopedia articles can be given a different entry name. As such, dictionary entries are not fully translatable into other languages, but encyclopedia articles can be.\n\n\nIn practice, however, the distinction is not concrete, as there is no clear-cut difference between factual, \"encyclopedic\" information and linguistic information such as appear in dictionaries.\n Thus encyclopedias may contain material that is also found in dictionaries, and vice versa.\n In particular, dictionary entries often contain factual information about the thing named by the word.\n\n\nThe earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the \n of \n, a \n statesman living in the 1st century AD.\n He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering \n, architecture, medicine, \n, geology, and all aspects of the world around him.\n This work became very popular in \n, was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470, and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the \n world, and especially \n, \n and \n.\n\nThe Spanish scholar \n was the first Christian writer to try to compile a \n of universal knowledge, the \n (\n), also known by classicists as the \n (abbreviated \n.). This encyclopedia—the first such Christian \n—formed a huge compilation of 448 chapters in 20 books\n based on hundreds of classical sources, including the \n. Of the \n in its time it was said \n, \"practically everything that it is necessary to know\".\n Among the areas covered were: \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, the \n and \n sects, \n \n, \n, \n, \n and \n, the \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n\nAnother Christian encyclopedia was the \n of \n (543–560) dedicated to the Christian divinity and the seven liberal arts.\n The encyclopedia of \n, a massive 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, had 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval \n compilers. The text was arranged alphabetically with some slight deviations from common vowel order and placed in the Greek alphabet.\n\n\nFrom India, the \n (Kannada: ಸಿರಿಭೂವಲಯ), dated between 800 A.D. to 15th century, is a work of \n literature written by \n, a Jain monk. It is unique because rather than employing alphabets, it is composed entirely in \n. Many philosophies which existed in the Jain classics are eloquently and skillfully interpreted in the work.\n\nThe enormous encyclopedic work in China of the \n, compiled by the 11th century during the early \n (960–1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the \n, amounted to 9.4 million \n in 1,000 written volumes. The \n (completed 1408) comprised 11,095 volumes.\n\nThere were many great encyclopedists throughout Chinese history, including the scientist and statesman \n (1031–1095) with his \n of 1088; the statesman, inventor, and agronomist \n (active 1290–1333) with his \n of 1313;  and \n (1587–1666) with his \n. Song Yingxing was termed the \"\n of China\" by British historian \n.\n\n\nBefore the advent of the printing press, encyclopedic works were all hand-copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it.\nDuring the \n, the creation of \n allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her copy. The \n by \n was posthumously printed in 1501 by \n in \n. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by \n), newly discovered and translated. The \n by \n, printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the \n.\n\nFinancial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. Middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws.\n\n is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English \n – to give its full title. Organized alphabetically, its content does indeed contain an explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but of the arts and sciences themselves. \n contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710.\n\n (\n for 'Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts and Crafts'),\n better known as \n (\n \n), was a general encyclopedia published in \n between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the \n. It was edited by \n and, until 1759, co-edited by \n.\n\n\nThe \n is most famous for representing the thought of the \n. According to Denis Diderot in the article \"Encyclopédie\", the \nEncyclopédie\n\n\nThe \n (\n for \n) is a \n English-language \n. It has been published by Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. since 1768, although the company has changed ownership seven times. The encyclopaedia is maintained by about 100 full-time editors and more than 4,000 contributors. The 2010 version of the 15th edition, which spans 32 volumes\n and 32,640 pages, was the last printed edition. Since 2016, it has been published exclusively as an \n.\n\nPrinted for 244 years, the \n was the longest-running in-print encyclopaedia in the English language. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in the Scottish capital of \n, as three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size: the second edition was 10 volumes,\n and by its fourth edition (1801–1810) it had expanded to 20 volumes.\n Its rising stature as a scholarly work helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th (1875–1889) and \n (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Starting with the 11th edition and following its acquisition by an American firm, the \n shortened and simplified articles to broaden its appeal to the North American market. \n\nIn 1933, the \n became the first encyclopaedia to adopt \"continuous revision\", in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted, with every article updated on a schedule.\n In the 21st century, the \n suffered first from competition with the digital multimedia encyclopaedia \n,\n and later with the online \n encyclopaedia \n.\n\n\nIn March 2012, it announced it would no longer publish printed editions and would focus instead on the online version.\n Britannica has been assessed to be politically closer to the centre of the US political spectrum than Wikipedia.\n\n\n \n (\n for \n) is a \n encyclopedia which until 2009 was published by the \n printing house.\n\nThe first edition originated in the \n published by Renatus Gotthelf Löbel and Franke in \n 1796–1808. Renamed \n in 1928 and \n from 1966, the current\n 21st thirty-volume edition contains about 300,000 entries on about 24,000 pages, with about 40,000 maps, graphics and tables. It is the largest German-language printed encyclopedia in the 21st century.\n\nIn the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were \n and \n. As many as 90% were sold \n.\n Jack Lynch says in his book \n that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, \"They were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.\" A 1961 \n ad said, \"You are holding your family's future in your hands right now,\" while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.\n As of the 1990s, two of the most prominent encyclopedias published in the United States were \n and \n.\n\n\nBy the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on \n for use with \n. This was the usual way computer users accessed encyclopedic knowledge from the 1980s and 1990s. Later, \n discs replaced CD-ROMs, and by the mid-2000s, \n were dominant and replaced disc-based software encyclopedias.\n\n\nCD-ROM encyclopedias were usually a \n or \n (3.0, 3.1 or 95/98) application on a CD-ROM disc. The user would execute the encyclopedia's software program to see a menu that allowed them to start browsing the encyclopedia's articles, and most encyclopedias also supported a way to search the contents of the encyclopedia. The article text was usually \n and also included \n, \n clips (for example in articles about historical speeches or musical instruments), and \n. In the CD-ROM age, the video clips had usually a low resolution, often 160x120 or 320x240 pixels. Such encyclopedias which made use of photos, audio and video were also called \n. \n\n's \n, launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009.\n Other examples of CD-ROM encyclopedia are \n Multimedia Encyclopedia and \n.\n\nDigital encyclopedias enable \"Encyclopedia Services\" (such as \n) to facilitate programmatic access to the content.\n\n\nThe concept of a free encyclopedia began with the \n proposal on \n in 1993, which outlined an Internet-based \n to which anyone could submit content that would be freely accessible. Early projects in this vein included \n and \n. In 1999, \n proposed the \n, an online encyclopedia which, similar to the \n, would be a \"generic\" resource. The concept was very similar to Interpedia, but more in line with Stallman's \n philosophy.\n\nIt was not until \n and later \n that a stable free encyclopedia project was able to be established on the Internet.\n\nThe \n, which was started in 2001, became the world's largest encyclopedia in 2004 at the 300,000 article stage.\n By late 2005, Wikipedia had produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with content licensed under the \n \n. As of August 2009,\n Wikipedia had over 3 million articles in English and well over 10 million combined articles in over 250 languages. Today, Wikipedia has \n articles in English, over 60 million combined articles in over 300 languages, and over 250 million combined pages including project and discussion pages.\n\n\nSince 2002, other free encyclopedias appeared, including \n (2005–) and \n (2006–) in Chinese, and Google's \n (2008–2012) in English. Some MediaWiki-based encyclopedias have appeared, usually under a license compatible with Wikipedia, including \n (2002–2021) in Spanish and  \n (2006–), \n (2006–), and \n (2007–) in English, the latter of which had become inactive by 2014.\n\n"},

From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of \n and \n, Germany conquered or controlled much of \n in a military alliance called the Axis with \n, \n, and other countries. Following the onset of campaigns in \n and \n, and the \n in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the \n, with the war in the \n, the aerial \n, \n of the UK, and the \n. In June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in \n, opening the \n, the largest land \n in history.\n\nJapan aimed to \n, and by 1937 was at war with the \n.

In 1944, the Western Allies \n, while the Soviet Union \n and pushed Germany and its allies back. During 1944–1945, Japan suffered reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the \n and captured key western Pacific islands.

Following the refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the \n, the US \n on \n on 6 August and \n on 9 August. Faced with imminent \n, the possibility of more atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's \n into the war against Japan on the eve of \n, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender, signing \n on \n.\n\nWorld War II changed the political alignment and social structure of the world, and it set the foundation for the international order for the rest of the 20th century and into the 21st century. The \n was established to foster international cooperation and prevent conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the UK, and the US—becoming the \n of its \n. The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival \n, setting the stage for the \n. In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the \n and \n. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards \n.\n\nWorld War II began in Europe on 1 September 1939\n with the \n and the \n and \n's declaration of war on Germany two days later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of the \n include the start of the \n on 7 July 1937,\n or the earlier \n, on 19 September 1931.\n Others follow the British historian \n, who stated that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II in 1941.\n Other theorised starting dates for World War II include the \n on 3 October 1935.\n The British historian \n views the beginning of World War\nII as the \n fought between \n and the forces of \n and the \n from May to September 1939.\n Others view the \n as the start or prelude to World War II.\n\n\nThe exact date of the war's end also is not universally agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (\n), rather than with the formal \n on 2 September 1945, which officially \n. A \n was signed in 1951.\n A 1990 \n allowed the \n to take place and resolved most post–World War\nII issues.\n No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,\n although the state of war between the two countries was terminated by the \n, which also restored full diplomatic relations between them.\n\n\n had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the \n—including \n, \n, \n, and the \n—and the 1917 \n in \n, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, the victorious \n, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new \n were created out of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires.\n\n\nTo prevent a future world war, the \n was established in 1920 by the \n. The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military, and \n, as well as settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration.\n\n\nDespite strong pacifist sentiment \n,\n \n and \n \n had emerged in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the \n. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all \n, while German annexation of other states was prohibited, \n were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's \n.\n\n\nThe German Empire was dissolved in the \n, and a democratic government, later known as the \n, was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the political right and left. Italy, as an Entente ally, had made some post-war territorial gains; however, Italian nationalists were angered that the \n by the United Kingdom and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled in the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the \n movement led by \n seized power in Italy with a nationalist, \n, and \n agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing, and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making Italy a world power, promising the creation of a \"\n\".\n\n\n, after an \n in 1923, eventually \n in 1933 when \n and the Reichstag appointed him. Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself \n of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a \n, and soon began a massive \n.\n France, seeking to secure its alliance with Italy, \n, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the \n was legally reunited with Germany, and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.\n\n\nThe United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the \n in April 1935 in order to contain Germany, a key step towards \n; however, that June, the United Kingdom made an \n with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's \n, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect, though, the \n was required to go through the bureaucracy of the League of Nations, which rendered it essentially toothless.\n The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the \n in August of the same year.\n\n\nHitler defied the Versailles and \n by \n in March 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of \n.\n In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the \n. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the \n, which Italy joined the following year.\n\n\nThe \n (KMT) party in China launched a \n against \n and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in \n against its former \n allies\n and \n. In 1931, an \n \n, which had long sought influence in China\n as the first step of what its government saw as the country's \n, staged the \n as a pretext to \n and establish the \n of \n.\n\n\nChina appealed to the \n to stop the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being \n for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in \n, \n and \n, until the \n was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in \n, and \n.\n After the 1936 \n, the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire to present \n to oppose Japan.\n\n\nThe \n was a brief \n that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war began with the invasion of the \n (also known as \n) by the armed forces of the \n (\n), which was launched from \n and \n.\n The war resulted in the \n of Ethiopia and its \n into the newly created colony of \n (\n, or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the \n as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, \n when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's \n.\n The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion.\n Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing \n.\n\n\nWhen civil war broke out in Spain, Hitler and Mussolini lent military support to the \n, led by General \n. Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis: Mussolini sent more than 70,000 ground troops, 6,000 aviation personnel, and 720 aircraft to Spain.\n The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the \n. More than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the \n, also fought against the Nationalists. Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this \n as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. The Nationalists won the civil war in April 1939; Franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during World War\nII but \n.\n His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of \n to fight on the \n.\n\n\nIn July 1937, Japan captured the former Chinese imperial capital of \n after instigating the \n, which culminated in the Japanese campaign to invade all of China.\n The Soviets quickly signed a \n to lend \n support, effectively ending China's prior \n. From September to November, the Japanese attacked \n, engaged the \n \n,\n and fought \n \n.\n \n \n deployed his \n to \n, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push Chinese forces back, \n in December 1937. After the fall of Nanking, tens or hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians and disarmed combatants were \n.\n\n\nIn March 1938, Nationalist Chinese forces won their \n, but then the city of \n \n in May.\n In June 1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by \n; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defences at \n, but the \n by October.\n Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to \n and continued the war.\n\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1930s, Japanese forces in \n had sporadic border clashes with the Soviet Union and \n. The Japanese doctrine of \n, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time. This policy would prove difficult to maintain in light of the Japanese defeat at \n in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War\n and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets. Japan and the Soviet Union eventually signed a \n in April 1941, and Japan adopted the doctrine of \n, promoted by the Navy, which took its focus southward and eventually led to war with the United States and the Western Allies.\n\n\nIn Europe, Germany and Italy were becoming more aggressive. In March 1938, Germany \n, again provoking \n from other European powers.\n Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the \n, an area of \n with a predominantly \n population. Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister \n and conceded this territory to Germany in the \n, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands.\n Soon afterwards, Germany and Italy forced Czechoslovakia to \n to Hungary, and Poland annexed the \n region of Czechoslovakia.\n\n\nAlthough all of Germany's stated demands had been satisfied by the agreement, privately Hitler was furious that British interference had prevented him from seizing all of Czechoslovakia in one operation. In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish \"war-mongers\" and in January 1939 \n to challenge British naval supremacy. In March 1939, \n and subsequently split it into the German \n and a pro-German \n, the \n.\n Hitler also delivered an \n on 20 March 1939, forcing the concession of the \n, formerly the German \n.\n\n\nGreatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the \n, the United Kingdom and France \n; when \n in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the \n and \n.\n Shortly after the \n-\n pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the \n.\n Hitler accused the United Kingdom and Poland of trying to \"encircle\" Germany and renounced the \n and the \n.\n\n\nThe situation became a crisis in late August as German troops continued to mobilise against the Polish border. On 23 August the Soviet Union signed \n with Germany,\n after tripartite negotiations for a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom, and Soviet Union had stalled.\n This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet \"spheres of influence\" (western \n and Lithuania for Germany; \n, Finland, \n, \n and \n for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence.\n The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War\nI. Immediately afterwards, Hitler ordered the attack to proceed on 26 August, but upon hearing that the United Kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with Poland and that Italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.\n\n\nIn response to British requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, Germany made demands on Poland, which served as a pretext to worsen relations.\n On 29 August, Hitler demanded that a Polish \n immediately travel to Berlin to negotiate the handover of \n, and to allow a \n in the \n in which the German minority would vote on secession.\n The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30–31 August in a confrontational meeting with the British ambassador \n, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected.\n\n\nOn 1 September 1939, Germany \n after \n several \n as a pretext to initiate the invasion.\n The first German attack of the war came against the \n.\n The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum for Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, Britain and France declared war on Germany,\n followed by \n, \n, \n, and \n. During the \n period, the alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a \n.\n The Western Allies also began a \n, which aimed to damage the country's economy and war effort.\n Germany responded by ordering \n against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the \n.\n\n\nOn 8 September, German troops reached the suburbs of \n. The Polish \n to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the \n. Remnants of the Polish army broke through to \n. On 17 September 1939, two days after signing a \n, the \n under the supposed pretext that the Polish state had ceased to exist.\n On 27 September, the Warsaw garrison surrendered to the Germans, and \n \n. Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead, it formed the \n and a \n in occupied Poland.\n A significant part of Polish military personnel \n and Latvia; many of them later \n in other theatres of the war.\n\n\nGermany \n Poland and \n; the Soviet Union \n; small shares of Polish territory were transferred to \n and \n. On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union. The proposal was rejected\n and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France,\n which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather.\n\n\nAfter the outbreak of war in Poland, Stalin threatened \n, \n, and \n with military invasion, forcing the three \n to sign \n allowing the creation of Soviet military bases in these countries; in October 1939, significant Soviet military contingents were moved there.\n \n refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union. \n in November 1939,\n and was subsequently expelled from the \n for this crime of aggression.\n Despite overwhelming numerical superiority, Soviet military success during the \n was modest,\n and the Finno-Soviet war ended in March 1940 with \n.\n\n\nIn June 1940, the Soviet Union \n the entire territories of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania,\n as well as the Romanian regions of \n. In August 1940, Hitler imposed the \n on Romania which led to the transfer of \n to Hungary.\n In September 1940, Bulgaria demanded \n from Romania with German and Italian support, leading to the \n.\n The loss of one-third of Romania's 1939 territory caused a coup against King Carol II, turning Romania into a fascist dictatorship under Marshal \n, with a course set towards the Axis in the hopes of a German guarantee.\n Meanwhile, German-Soviet political relations and economic co-operation\n gradually stalled,\n and both states began preparations for war.\n\n\nIn April 1940, \n to protect shipments of \n, which the Allies were \n.\n \n, and \n, Norway was conquered within two months.\n \n led to the resignation of Prime Minister \n, who was replaced by \n on 10\nMay 1940.\n\n\nOn the same day, Germany \n. To circumvent the strong \n fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of \n, \n, and \n.\n The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the \n region,\n which was mistakenly perceived by the Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles.\n By successfully implementing new \n tactics, the \n rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille. The United Kingdom was able \n from the continent by early June, although they had to abandon almost all their equipment.\n\n\nOn 10 June, \n, declaring war on both France and the United Kingdom.\n The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and \n fell to them on 14\nJune.

In September the United States further agreed to a \n.\n Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941.\n In December 1940, Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an \"\n\" and promoting \n programmes of military and humanitarian aid to support the British war effort; Lend-Lease was later extended to the other Allies, including the Soviet Union after it was \n by Germany.\n The United States started strategic planning to prepare for a full-scale offensive against Germany.\n\n\nAt the end of September 1940, the \n formally united Japan, Italy, and Germany as the \n. The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country—with the exception of the Soviet Union—that attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three.\n The Axis expanded in November 1940 when \n, \n, and \n joined.\n \n and \n later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture \n.\n\n\nIn early June 1940, the Italian \n \n, a British possession. From late summer to early autumn, Italy \n and made an \n. In October, \n, but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes.\n To assist Italy and prevent Britain from gaining a foothold, Germany prepared to invade the Balkans, which would threaten Romanian oil fields and strike against British dominance of the Mediterranean.\n\n\nIn December 1940, British Empire forces began \n against Italian forces in Egypt and \n.\n The offensives were successful; by early February 1941, Italy had lost control of eastern Libya, and large numbers of Italian troops had been taken prisoner. The \n also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission after a \n, and neutralising several more warships at the \n.\n\n\nItalian defeats prompted Germany to \n to North Africa; at the end of March 1941, \n's \n \n which drove back Commonwealth forces.\n In less than a month, Axis forces advanced to western Egypt and \n.\n\n\nBy late March 1941, \n and \n signed the \n; however, the Yugoslav government was \n by pro-British nationalists. Germany and Italy responded with simultaneous invasions of both \n and \n, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month.\n The airborne \n at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.\n Partisan warfare subsequently broke out against the \n, which continued until the end of the war.\n\n\nIn the Middle East in May, Commonwealth forces \n which had been supported by German aircraft from bases within Vichy-controlled \n.\n Between June and July, British-led forces \n, assisted by the \n.\n\n\nWith the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations for war. With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany, and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in \n, the two powers signed the \n in April 1941.\n By contrast, the Germans were steadily making preparations for an attack on the Soviet Union, massing forces on the Soviet border.\n\n\nHitler believed that the United Kingdom's refusal to end the war was based on the hope that the United States and the Soviet Union would enter the war against Germany sooner or later.\n On 31 July 1940, Hitler decided that the Soviet Union should be eliminated and aimed for the conquest of \n, the \n and \n.\n However, other senior German officials like Ribbentrop saw an opportunity to create a Euro-Asian bloc against the British Empire by inviting the Soviet Union into the Tripartite Pact.\n In November 1940, \n to determine if the Soviet Union would join the pact. The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable. On 18 December 1940, Hitler issued the directive to prepare for an invasion of the Soviet Union.\n\n\nOn 22 June 1941, Germany, supported by Italy and Romania, invaded the Soviet Union in \n, with Germany accusing the Soviets of \n; they were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.\n The primary targets of this surprise offensive\n were the \n, Moscow and Ukraine, with the \n of ending the 1941 campaign near the \n—from the \n to the \n. Hitler's objectives were to eliminate the Soviet Union as a military power, exterminate \n, generate \n (\"living space\")\n by \n,\n and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat Germany's remaining rivals.\n\n\nAlthough the \n was preparing for strategic \n before the war,\n \n \n forced the \n to adopt \n. During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. By mid-August, however, the German \n decided to \n of a considerably depleted \n, and to divert the \n to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad.\n The \n was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further \n and industrially-developed Eastern Ukraine (the \n).\n\n\nThe diversion of three-quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the \n prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its \n.\n In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a \n and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the \n, which outlined British and American goals for the post-war world.\n In late August the British and Soviets \n to secure the \n, Iran's \n, and preempt any Axis advances through Iran toward the Baku oil fields or India.\n\n\nBy October, Axis powers had achieved \n in Ukraine and the Baltic region, with only the sieges of \n and \n continuing.\n A major \n was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops\n were forced to suspend the offensive.\n Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet \n was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential. The \n \n of the war in Europe had ended.\n\n\nBy early December, freshly mobilised \n allowed the Soviets to achieve numerical parity with Axis troops.\n This, as well as \n which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese \n,\n allowed the Soviets to begin a \n that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west.\n\n\nFollowing the Japanese \n \n in 1931, the Japanese shelling of the American \n in 1937, and the 1937–1938 \n, \n. In 1939, the United States notified Japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and American public opinion opposing Japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions—the \n—which banned U.S. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to Japan, and increased economic pressure on the Japanese regime.\n During 1939 Japan launched its \n, but was repulsed by late September.\n Despite \n by both sides, by 1940 the war between China and Japan was at a stalemate. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and \n in September 1940.\n\n\nChinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale \n in early 1940. In August, \n launched an \n; in retaliation, Japan instituted \n in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists.\n Continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces \n, effectively ending their co-operation.\n In March, the Japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the Chinese 19th army but was repulsed during \n.\n In September, Japan attempted to \n again and clashed with Chinese nationalist forces.\n\n\nGerman successes in Europe prompted Japan to increase pressure on European governments in \n. The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with oil supplies from the \n, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941.\n In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East. The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo.\n At the same time, Japan was \n, intending to take advantage of the German invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.\n\n\nSince early 1941, the United States and Japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in China. During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate.\n At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them.\n Roosevelt reinforced \n and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any \"neighboring countries\".\n\n\nFrustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American–British–Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war. Emperor \n, after initial hesitation about Japan's chances of victory,\n began to favour Japan's entry into the war.\n As a result, Prime Minister \n resigned.\n Hirohito refused the recommendation to appoint \n in his place, choosing War Minister \n instead.\n On 3 November, Nagano explained in detail the plan of the \n to the Emperor.\n On 5 November, Hirohito approved in imperial conference the operations plan for the war.\n On 20 November, the new government presented an interim proposal as its final offer. It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan. In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina.\n The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.\n That meant Japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in China, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the Dutch East Indies by force;\n the Japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.\n\n\nJapan planned to seize European colonies in Asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the Central Pacific. The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.\n To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the \n and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset.\n On 7 December 1941 (8 December in Asian time zones), Japan attacked British and American holdings with near-simultaneous \n.\n These included an \n and \n, as well as invasions of \n, \n, \n,\n \n, and \n.\n\n\nThese attacks led the \n, \n, China, Australia, and several other states to formally declare war on Japan, whereas the Soviet Union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with European Axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with Japan.\n Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States\n in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt.\n\n\nOn 1 January 1942, the \n—the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and the United States—and 22 smaller or exiled governments issued the \n, thereby affirming the \n and agreeing not to sign a \n with the Axis powers.\n\n\nDuring 1942, Allied officials debated on the appropriate \n to pursue. All agreed that \n was the primary objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, \n on Germany through France. The Soviets demanded a second front. The British argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolstering resistance forces; Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour, without using large-scale armies.\n Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.\n\n\nAt the \n in early 1943, the Allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 Declaration and demanded the \n of their enemies. The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.\n Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland, and to invade France in 1944.\n\n\nBy the end of April 1942, Japan and its ally \n had almost conquered \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n, inflicting severe losses on Allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners.\n Despite stubborn \n, the \n was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile.\n On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the \n and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.\n Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the \n, \n, and \n,\n and \n at \n, Australia. In January 1942, the only Allied success against Japan was a Chinese \n.\n These easy victories over the unprepared U.S. and European opponents left Japan overconfident, and overextended.\n\n\nIn early May 1942, Japan initiated operations to \n by \n and thus sever communications and supply lines between the United States and Australia. The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the \n.\n Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier \n, was to seize \n and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to \n in Alaska.\n In mid-May, Japan started the \n in China, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided the surviving American airmen in the Doolittle Raid by destroying Chinese air bases and fighting against the Chinese 23rd and 32nd Army Groups.\n In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans had broken \n in late May and were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive \n over the \n.\n\n\nWith its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan attempted to capture \n by an \n in the \n.\n The Americans planned a counterattack against Japanese positions in the southern \n, primarily \n, as a first step towards capturing \n, the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nBoth plans started in July, but by mid-September, \n took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the \n, where they faced Australian and United States troops in the \n.\n Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal. By the start of 1943, the Japanese were defeated on the island and \n.\n In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations. The first was a disastrous \n in late 1942 that forced a retreat back to India by May 1943.\n The second was the \n behind Japanese frontlines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results.\n\n\nDespite considerable losses, in early 1942 Germany and its allies stopped a major Soviet offensive in \n and \n, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year.\n In May, the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the \n and at \n,\n and then in June 1942 launched their main \n against southern Russia, to seize the \n and occupy the \n \n, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. The Germans split \n into two groups: \n advanced to the lower \n and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while \n headed towards the \n. The Soviets decided to make their stand at Stalingrad on the Volga.\n\n\nBy mid-November, the Germans had \n in bitter \n. The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an \n,\n and an assault on the \n, though the latter failed disastrously.\n By early February 1943, the German Army had taken tremendous losses; German troops at Stalingrad had been defeated,\n and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another \n, creating a \n in their front line around the Soviet city of \n.\n\n\nExploiting poor American naval command decisions, \n.\n By November 1941, Commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive in North Africa, \n, and reclaimed all the gains the Germans and Italians had made.\n The Germans also launched a North African offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the \n by early February,\n followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives.\n Concerns that the Japanese might use bases in \n caused the British to \n in early May 1942.\n An Axis \n forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were \n.\n On the Continent, raids of Allied \n on strategic targets, culminating in the failed \n,\n demonstrated the Western Allies' inability to launch an invasion of continental Europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.\n\n\nIn August 1942, the Allies succeeded in repelling a \n and, at a high cost, managed to \n.\n A few months later, the Allies \n in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya.\n This attack was followed up shortly after by \n, which resulted in the region joining the Allies.\n Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the \n;\n although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to \n to prevent its capture by German forces.\n Axis forces in Africa withdrew into \n, which was \n in May 1943.\n\n\nIn June 1943, the British and Americans began \n against Germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and \"\n\" the civilian population.\n The \n was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.\n\n\nAfter the Guadalcanal campaign, the Allies initiated several operations against Japan in the Pacific. In May 1943, Canadian and U.S. forces were sent to \n.\n Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to \n, and \n.\n By the end of March 1944, the Allies had completed both of these objectives and had also \n in the \n. In April, the Allies launched an operation to \n.\n\n\nIn the Soviet Union, both the Germans and the Soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in \n. On 5 July 1943, Germany \n. Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' well-constructed defences,\n and for the first time in the war, Hitler cancelled an operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success.\n This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' \n launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the \n later that month.\n\n\nOn 12 July 1943, the Soviets launched their own \n, thereby dispelling any chance of German victory or even stalemate in the east. The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority,\n giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front.\n The Germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified \n, but the Soviets broke through it at \n and the \n.\n\n\nOn 3 September 1943, the Western Allies \n, following \n and the ensuing German occupation of Italy.\n Germany, with the help of fascists, responded to the armistice by \n that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas,\n and creating a series of defensive lines.\n German special forces then \n, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the \n,\n causing an \n. The Western Allies fought through several lines until reaching the \n in mid-November.\n\n\nGerman operations in the Atlantic also suffered. By \n, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign.\n In November 1943, \n and Winston Churchill met with \n \n and then with Joseph Stalin \n.\n The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory\n and the military planning for the \n,\n while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.\n\n\nFrom November 1943, during the seven-week \n, the Chinese awaited allied relief as they forced Japan to fight a costly war of attrition.\n In January 1944, the Allies launched a \n and tried to outflank it with \n.\n\n\nOn 27 January 1944, \n troops launched \n that expelled German forces from the \n, thereby ending the \n.\n The \n was \n by the German \n aided by \n hoping to \n. This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the \n region.\n By late May 1944, the Soviets had \n, \n, and made \n, which were repulsed by the Axis troops.\n The Allied offensives in Italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several German divisions to retreat, Rome was captured on June 4.\n\n\nThe Allies had mixed success in mainland Asia. In March 1944, the Japanese launched the first of two invasions, \n,\n and soon besieged Commonwealth positions at \n and \n.\n In May 1944, British and Indian forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove Japanese troops back to Burma by July,\n and Chinese forces that had \n in late 1943 \n in \n.\n The \n of China aimed to destroy China's main fighting forces, secure railways between Japanese-held territory and capture Allied airfields.\n By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of \n and begun a \n.\n\n\nOn 6 June 1944 (commonly known as \n), after three years of Soviet pressure,\n the Western Allies \n.

An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by \n in the Netherlands failed.\n After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but \n. In Italy, the Allied advance slowed due to the \n.\n\n\nOn 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus (\"\n\") that nearly destroyed the German \n.\n Soon after that, \n forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland. The Soviets formed the \n to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish \n; the Soviet Red Army remained in the \n district on the other side of the \n and watched passively as the Germans quelled the \n initiated by the Armia Krajowa.\n The \n in \n was also quelled by the Germans.\n The Soviet \n's \n cut off and destroyed the \n and triggered \n and \n, followed by those countries' shift to the Allied side.\n\n\nIn September 1944, Soviet troops advanced into \n and forced the rapid withdrawal of German Army Groups \n and \n in \n, \n and Yugoslavia to rescue them from being cut off.\n By this point, the communist-led \n under Marshal \n, who had led an \n against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south. In northern \n, the Soviet \n, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint \n on 20 October. A few days later, the Soviets launched a \n against \n Hungary that lasted until \n in February 1945.\n Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, \n to the \n in the \n denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a \n on relatively mild conditions,\n although Finland was forced to \n.\n\n\nBy the start of July 1944, Commonwealth forces in Southeast Asia had repelled the Japanese sieges in \n, pushing the Japanese back to the \n while the Chinese captured Myitkyina.

In mid-June 1944, they began their \n and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the \n. These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, \n, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces \n; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the \n, one of the largest naval battles in history.\n\n\nOn 16 December 1944, Germany made a last attempt to split the Allies on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch \n and \n, hoping to encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and prompt a political settlement after capturing their primary supply port at \n. By 16 January 1945, this offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.\n In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Red Army attacked in Poland, \n river in Germany, and \n.\n On 4 February Soviet, British, and U.S. leaders met for the \n.

By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine \n and \n of the \n, \n.\n In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and retake Budapest, Germany launched \n against Soviet troops near \n.

Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, \n, \n and quickly defeated the \n, which was the largest Japanese fighting force.\n These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms.\n The Red Army also captured the \n and the \n. On the night of 9–10 August 1945, Emperor \n announced his decision to accept the terms demanded by the Allies in the \n.\n On 15 August, the Emperor communicated this decision to the Japanese people through a speech broadcast on the radio (\n, literally \"broadcast in the Emperor's voice\").\n On 15 August 1945, \n, with the \n finally signed at \n on the deck of the American battleship \n on 2 September 1945, ending the war.\n\n\nThe Allies established occupation administrations in \n and \n, both initially divided between western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, respectively. However, their paths soon diverged. In Germany, the \n and \n controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union officially ended in 1949, with the respective zones becoming separate countries, \n and \n.\n In Austria, however, occupation continued until 1955, when a joint settlement between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union permitted the reunification of Austria as a democratic state officially non-aligned with any political bloc (although in practice having better relations with the Western Allies). A \n program in Germany led to the prosecution of Nazi war criminals in the \n and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.\n\n\nGermany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory. Among the eastern territories, \n, \n and most of \n were taken over by Poland,\n and \n was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, followed by the \n of the nine million Germans from these provinces,\n as well as three million Germans from the \n in Czechoslovakia. By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east. The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the \n,\n from which \n;\n north-east Romania,\n parts of eastern Finland,\n and the \n were \n.\n Italy \n, \n and some \n.\n\n\nIn an effort to maintain \n,\n the Allies formed the \n,\n which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945,\n and adopted the \n in 1948 as a common standard for all \n.\n The \n that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the \n of the UN's \n.\n The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, \n the \n and the \n in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its \n, the \n, following the \n in 1991. The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.\n\n\nBesides Germany, the rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet \n.\n Most eastern and central European countries fell into \n, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities. As a result, \n,\n \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n became Soviet \n. Communist \n conducted a fully \n, causing \n.\n A \n was put down with Anglo-American support and the country remained aligned with the West.\n\n\nPost-war division of the world was formalised by two international military alliances, the United States-led \n and the Soviet-led \n.\n The long period of political tensions and military competition between them—the \n—would be accompanied by an unprecedented \n and number of \n throughout the world.\n\n\nIn Asia, the United States led the \n and \n in the Western Pacific, while the Soviets annexed \n and the \n.\n \n, formerly \n, was \n by the Soviet Union in the \n and the United States in the \n between 1945 and 1948. Separate republics emerged on both sides of the 38th parallel in 1948, each claiming to be the legitimate government for all of Korea, which led ultimately to the \n.\n\n\nIn China, nationalist and communist forces resumed \n in June 1946. Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to \n in 1949.\n In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the \n and the \n marked the escalation of the \n. While European powers attempted to retain some or all of their \n, their losses of prestige and resources during the war rendered this unsuccessful, leading to \n.\n\n\nThe global economy suffered heavily from the war, although participating nations were affected differently. The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a \n, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy.\n The Allied occupational authorities pursued a policy of \n from 1945 to 1948.\n Due to international trade interdependencies, this policy led to an economic stagnation in Europe and delayed European recovery from the war for several years.\n\n\nAt the \n in July 1944, the Allied nations drew up an economic framework for the post-war world. The agreement created the \n (IMF) and the \n (IBRD), which later became part of the \n. The \n lasted until 1973.\n Recovery began with the mid-1948 \n, and was sped up by the liberalisation of European economic policy that the U.S. \n economic aid (1948–1951) both directly and indirectly caused.\n The post-1948 West German recovery has been called the \n.\n Italy also experienced an \n and the \n.\n By contrast, the United Kingdom was in a state of economic ruin,\n and although receiving a quarter of the total Marshall Plan assistance, more than any other European country,\n it continued in relative economic decline for decades.\n The Soviet Union, despite enormous human and material losses, also experienced rapid increase in production in the immediate post-war era,\n having seized and transferred most of Germany's industrial plants and exacted \n from its satellite states.\n Japan recovered much later.\n China returned to its pre-war industrial production by 1952.\n\n\nEstimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded.\n Most suggest that some 60 million people died in the war, including about \n and 40 million civilians.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union alone lost around 27 million people during the war,\n including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths.\n A quarter of the total people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed.\n Germany sustained 5.3 million military losses, mostly on the Eastern Front and during the final battles in Germany.\n\n\nAn estimated 11\n to 17 million\n civilians died as a direct or as an indirect result of Hitler's \n, including \n of \n, along with \n, \n, at least 1.9 million ethnic \n and \n (including Russians, Ukrainians and Belarusians), and \n.\n Between 1941 and 1945, more than 200,000 ethnic \n, along with Roma and Jews, were \n by the Axis-aligned Croatian \n in \n.\n Concurrently, \n and \n were \n by Serb nationalist \n,\n with an estimated 50,000–68,000 victims (of which 41,000 were civilians).\n Also, more than 100,000 Poles were massacred by the \n in the \n, between 1943 and 1945.\n At the same time, about 10,000–15,000 Ukrainians were killed by the Polish \n and other Polish units, in reprisal attacks.\n\n\nIn Asia and the Pacific, the number of people killed by Japanese troops remains contested. According to R.J. Rummel, the Japanese killed between 3\nmillion and more than 10 million people, with the most probable case of almost 6,000,000 people.\n According to the British historian \n, civilian deaths are between 10 million and 20 million, whereas Chinese military casualties (killed and wounded) are estimated to be over five million.\n Other estimates say that up to 30 million people, most of them civilians, were killed.\n The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the \n, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered.\n Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the \n. General \n implemented the policy in \n and \n.\n\n\nAxis forces employed \n and \n. The \n used a variety of such weapons during its \n (\n)\n and in \n.\n Both the Germans and the \n such weapons against civilians,\n and sometimes on \n.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union was responsible for the \n of 22,000 Polish officers,\n and the imprisonment or execution of \n by the \n secret police, along with \n, in the \n and \n annexed by the Red Army.\n Soviet soldiers committed mass rapes in occupied territories, especially \n.\n The exact number of German women and girls raped by Soviet troops during the war and occupation is uncertain, but historians estimate their numbers are likely in the hundreds of thousands, and possibly as many as two million,\n while figures for women raped by German soldiers in the Soviet Union go as far as ten million.\n\n\nThe mass bombing of cities in Europe and Asia has often been called a war crime, although no \n or specific \n \n with respect to \n existed before or during World War II.\n The USAAF \n, killing 393,000 civilians, including the \n, and destroying 65% of built-up areas.\n\n\n, under the \n of Adolf Hitler, was responsible for murdering about 6\nmillion Jews in what is now known as \n. They also murdered an additional 4\nmillion others who were deemed \"\n\" (including the \n and \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n) as part of a program of deliberate extermination, in effect becoming a \"\n state\".\n \n were kept in especially unbearable conditions, and 3.6 million Soviet POWs out of 5.7 million died in Nazi camps during the war.\n In addition to \n, \n were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale. Nazi Germany extensively used \n; about 12 million \n from German-occupied countries were abducted and used as a slave work force in German industry, agriculture and war economy.\n\n\nThe Soviet \n became a \n system of deadly camps during 1942–43, when wartime privation and hunger caused numerous deaths of inmates,\n including foreign citizens of Poland and \n occupied in 1939–40 by the Soviet Union, as well as Axis \n.\n By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to \n evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators.\n\n\nJapanese \n, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. The \n found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 percent (for American POWs, 37 percent),\n seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians.\n While 37,583 prisoners from the UK, 28,500 from the Netherlands, and 14,473 from the United States were released after the \n, the number of Chinese released was only 56.\n\n\nAt least five million Chinese civilians from northern China and Manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the \n, or \n, for work in mines and war industries. After 1942, the number reached 10 million.\n In \n, between 4\nand 10 million \n (Japanese: \"manual labourers\"), were forced to work by the Japanese military. About 270,000 of these Javanese labourers were sent to other Japanese-held areas in Southeast Asia, and only 52,000 were repatriated to Java.\n\n\nIn Europe, occupation came under two forms. In Western, Northern, and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the \n) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion reichsmarks (27.8 billion U.S. dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the \n of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.\n Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.\n\n\nIn the East, the intended gains of \n were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet \n policies denied resources to the German invaders.\n Unlike in the West, the \n encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the \"\n\" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by \n.\n The Nazis \n during the war in addition to Polish-Jewish victims of the Holocaust.\n Although \n formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East\n or the West\n until late 1943.\n\nIn Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the \n, essentially a Japanese \n which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples.\n Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination, \n frequently turned local public opinion against them.\n During Japan's initial conquest, it captured 4,000,000 barrels (640,000 m\n) of oil (~550,000 tonnes) left behind by retreating Allied forces; and by 1943, was able to get production in the Dutch East Indies up to 50 million barrels (7,900,000 m\n) of oil (~6.8 million tonnes), 76 percent of its 1940 output rate.\n\n\nIn the 1930s Britain and the United States of America together controlled almost 75% of world mineral output - essential for projecting military power.\n\n\nIn Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); including colonies, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.\n In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this reduces to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.\n\n\nThe United States produced about two-thirds of all munitions used by the Allies in World War II, including warships, transports, warplanes, artillery, tanks, trucks, and ammunition.\n\nThough the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies and the war evolved into one of \n.\n While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis was partly due to more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the \n,\n Allied \n,\n and Germany's late shift to a \n contributed significantly. Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so.\n To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of \n;\n \n about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe,\n while \n more than 18 million people in Far East Asia.\n\n\nAircraft were used for \n, as \n, \n, and \n, and each role developed considerably. Innovations included \n (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel);\n and \n (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war).\n \n also advanced, including defences such as \n and surface-to-air artillery, in particular the introduction of the \n. The use of the \n was pioneered and led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide.\n\n\nAdvances were made in nearly every aspect of \n, most notably with \n and \n. Although \n warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, \n, \n, and the \n established the carrier as the dominant capital ship (in place of the battleship).\n In the Atlantic, \n became a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the \n.\n Carriers were also more economical than \n due to the relatively low cost of aircraft\n and because they are not required to be as heavily armoured.\n Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the \n,\n were expected by all combatants to be important in the second. The British focused development on \n \n and tactics, such as \n and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the \n and \n tactics.\n Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the \n, \n, \n, and \n proved effective against German submarines.\n\n\n changed from the static frontlines of \n of World War I, which had relied on improved \n that outmatched the speed of both \n and \n, to increased mobility and \n. The \n, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.\n In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War\nI,\n and \n with increases in speed, armour and firepower.\n At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.\n This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.\n Many means of \n, including \n, \n (both towed and \n), \n, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.\n Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,\n and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I.\n The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German \n, and various \n which were suited to \n in urban and jungle settings.\n The \n, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.\n\n\nMost major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large \n for \n by designing \n machines, the most well-known being the German \n.\n Development of \n (\nnals \nelligence) and \n enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of \n and British \n, a \n for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the \n, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.\n Another component of \n was \n, which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as \n and \n.\n\n\nOther technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (\n, \n, and \n), \n and \n, the \n's development of \n, \n, the development of \n, and \n.\n \n was first \n during the war.\n\n"},

{"title": "Convoy - Wikipedia", "content": "A \n is a group of \n, typically motor vehicles or ships, traveling together for mutual support and protection. Often, a convoy is organized with armed defensive support and can help maintain cohesion within a unit. It may also be used in a non-military sense, for example when driving through remote areas.\n\nNaval convoys have been in use for centuries, with examples of merchant ships traveling under naval protection dating to the 12th century.\n The use of organized naval convoys dates from when ships began to be separated into specialist classes and national navies were established.\n\n\nBy the \n of the late 18th century, effective \n convoy \n had been developed to ward off \n and \n. Some convoys contained several hundred merchant ships. The most enduring system of convoys were the \n, that sailed from the 1520s until 1790.\n\nWhen merchant ships sailed independently, a privateer could cruise a shipping lane and capture ships as they passed. Ships sailing in convoy presented a much smaller target: a convoy was as hard to find as a single ship. Even if the privateer found a convoy and the wind was favourable for an attack, it could still hope to capture only a handful of ships before the rest managed to escape, and a small escort of warships could easily thwart it. As a result of the convoy system's effectiveness, wartime insurance premiums were consistently lower for ships that sailed in convoys.\n\n\nMany \n in the \n were fought around convoys, including:\n\nBy the end of the \n, the \n had in place a sophisticated convoy system to protect merchant ships.\n Losses of ships travelling out of convoy, however, were so high that no merchant ship was allowed to sail unescorted.\n\n\nIn the early 20th century, the \n changed the balance of power in convoy battles. Steaming faster than merchant ships and firing at long ranges, a single \n could destroy many ships in a convoy before the others could scatter over the horizon. To protect a convoy against a capital ship required providing it with an escort of another capital ship, at very high \n (i.e. potentially tying down multiple capital ships to defend different convoys against one opponent ship).\n\nBattleships were the main reason that the \n did not adopt convoy tactics at the start of the \n in \n. But the German capital ships had been bottled up in the North Sea, and the main threat to shipping came from \n. From a tactical point of view, World War I–era \n were similar to privateers in the age of sail. These submarines were only a little faster than the merchant ships they were attacking, and capable of sinking only a small number of vessels in a convoy because of their limited supply of torpedoes and shells. The Admiralty took a long time to respond to this change in the tactical position, and in April 1917 convoys were trialled, before being officially introduced in the Atlantic in September 1917.\n\nOther arguments against convoys were raised. The primary issue was the loss of productivity, as merchant shipping in convoy has to travel at the speed of the slowest vessel in the convoy and spent a considerable amount of time in ports waiting for the next convoy to depart. Further, large convoys were thought to overload port resources.\n\nActual analysis of shipping losses in World War I disproved all these arguments, at least so far as they applied to transatlantic and other long-distance traffic. Ships sailing in convoys were far less likely to be sunk, even when not provided with an escort. The loss of productivity due to convoy delays was small compared with the loss of productivity due to ships being sunk. Ports could deal more easily with convoys because they tended to arrive on schedule and so loading and unloading could be planned.\n\nIn his book \n, Norman Dixon suggested that the hostility towards convoys in the naval establishment were in part caused by a (sub-conscious) perception of convoys as effeminating, due to warships having to care for civilian merchant ships.\n Convoy duty also exposes the escorting warships to the sometimes hazardous conditions of the North Atlantic, with only rare occurrences of visible achievement (i.e. fending off a submarine assault).\n\nThe British adopted a convoy system, initially voluntary and later compulsory for almost all merchant ships, the moment that \n was declared. Each convoy consisted of between 30 and 70 mostly unarmed merchant ships.\n Canadian, and later American, supplies were vital for Britain to continue its war effort. The course of the \n was a long struggle as the Germans developed anti-convoy tactics and the British developed counter-tactics to thwart the Germans.\n\nThe capability of a heavily armed warship against a convoy was dramatically illustrated by the fate of \n. On November 5, 1940, the German heavy cruiser \n encountered the convoy. \n, \n, and \n were quickly destroyed, and  \n and \n falling afterwards. Only the sacrifices of the \n \n and the freighter \n to stall the \n, in addition to failing light, allowed the rest of the convoy to escape.\n\nThe deterrence value of a battleship in protecting a convoy was also dramatically illustrated when the German light battleships (referred by some as battlecruisers) \n and \n, mounting 11 in (28 cm) guns, came upon an eastbound British convoy (\n, with 41 ships) in the North Atlantic on February 8, 1941. When the Germans detected the slow but well-protected battleship \n escorting the convoy, they fled the scene rather than risk damage from her 15 in (38 cm) guns.\n\nThe enormous number of vessels involved and the frequency of engagements meant that statistical techniques could be applied to evaluate tactics: an early use of \n in war.\n\nPrior to overt participation in World War II, the US was actively engaged in convoys with the British in the North Atlantic Ocean, primarily supporting British activities in Iceland.\n\n\nAfter Germany declared war on the US, the US Navy decided not to organize convoys on the American eastern seaboard. US Fleet Admiral \n ignored advice on this subject from the British, as he had formed a poor opinion of the Royal Navy early in his career. The result was what the U-boat crews called their \n, which did not end until convoys were introduced.\n\n\nIn the Pacific Theater of World War II, \n merchant ships rarely traveled in convoys. Japanese destroyers were generally deficient in antisubmarine weaponry compared to their Allied counterparts, and the Japanese navy did not develop an inexpensive convoy escort like the Allies' \n/\n until it was too late. In the early part of the conflict, American submarines in the Pacific were ineffective as they suffered from timid tactics, faulty torpedoes, and poor deployment, while there were only small numbers of British and Dutch boats. U.S. Admiral \n's efforts, coupled with strenuous complaints from his captains, rectified these problems and U.S. submarines became much more successful by war's end. As a result, the Japanese merchant fleet was \n by the end of the war. Japanese submarines, unlike their U.S. and German equivalents, focused on U.S. battle fleets rather than merchant convoys, and while they did manage some early successes, sinking two U.S. carriers, they failed to significantly inhibit the invasion convoys carrying troops and equipment in support of the U.S. island-hopping campaign.\n\n\nSeveral notable battles in the South Pacific involved Allied bombers interdicting Japanese troopship convoys which were often defended by Japanese fighters, notable \n (13 November 1942), \n (5 January 1943), and the \n (2–4 March 1943).\n\nAt the \n, the effectiveness of the U.S. Navy's escorts was demonstrated when they managed to defend their troop convoy from a much larger and more powerful Japanese battle-fleet. The Japanese force comprised four battleships and numerous heavy cruisers, while the U.S. force consisted of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts. Large numbers of American aircraft (albeit without much anti-ship ordnance other than torpedoes) and aggressive tactics of the destroyers (with their radar-directed gunfire) allowed the U.S. to sink three Japanese heavy cruisers at the cost of one escort carrier and three destroyers.\n\nThe German anti-convoy \n included:\n\nThe Allied responses included:\n\nThey were also aided by\n\nMany naval battles of World War II were fought around convoys, including:\n\nThe convoy prefix indicates the route of the convoy. For example, 'PQ' would be Iceland to Northern Russia and 'QP' the return route.\n\nThe success of convoys as an anti-submarine tactic during the world wars can be ascribed to several reasons related to U-boat capabilities, the size of the ocean and convoy escorts.\n\nIn practice, \n and \n were limited in their capabilities. Submerged speed and endurance was limited and not suited for overhauling many ships. Even a surfaced U-boat could take several hours to gain an attack position. Torpedo capacity was also restricted to around fourteen (Type VII) or 24 (Type IX), thus limiting the number of attacks that could be made, particularly when multiple firings were necessary for a single target. There was a real problem for the U-boats and their adversaries in finding each other; with a tiny proportion of the ocean in sight, without intelligence or radar, warships and even aircraft would be fortunate in coming across a submarine. The Royal Navy and later the United States Navy each took time to learn this lesson. Conversely, a U-boat's radius of vision was even smaller and had to be supplemented by regular long-range reconnaissance flights.\n\nFor both major allied navies, it had been difficult to grasp that, however large a convoy, its \"footprint\" (the area within which it could be spotted) was far smaller than if the individual ships had traveled independently. In other words, a submarine had less chance of finding a single convoy than if it were scattered as single ships. Moreover, once an attack had been made, the submarine would need to regain an attack position on the convoy. If, however, an attack were thwarted by escorts, even if the submarine had escaped damage, it would have to remain submerged for its own safety and might only recover its position after many hours' hard work. U-boats patrolling areas with constant and predictable flows of sea traffic, such as the United States Atlantic coast in early 1942, could dismiss a missed opportunity in the certain knowledge that another would soon present itself.\n\nThe destruction of submarines required their discovery, an improbable occurrence on aggressive patrols, by chance alone. Convoys, however, presented irresistible targets and could not be ignored. For this reason, the U-boats presented themselves as targets to the escorts with increasing possibility of destruction. In this way, the Ubootwaffe suffered severe losses, for little gain, when pressing pack attacks on well-defended convoys.\n\nThe largest convoy effort since World War II was \n, the \n 1987–88 escort of reflagged \n \n in the \n during the \n.\n\nIn the present day, convoys are used as a tactic by navies to deter \n from capturing unarmed civilian freighters who would otherwise pose easy targets if they sailed alone.\n\nThe word \"convoy\" is also associated with groups of road vehicles being driven, mostly by volunteers, to deliver \n, supplies, and—a stated objective in some cases—\"solidarity\".\n\n\nIn the 1990s these convoys became common traveling from \n to countries of the former \n, in particular \n and \n, to deal with the aftermath of the wars there. They also travel to countries where standards of care in institutions such as orphanages are considered low by Western European standards, such as \n; and where other disasters have led to problems, such as around the \n in \n and \n.\n\nThe convoys are made possible partly by the relatively small geographic distances between the stable and affluent countries of Western Europe, and the areas of need in \n and, in a few cases, \n and even \n. They are often justified because although less directly cost-effective than mass freight transport, they emphasise the support of large numbers of small groups, and are quite distinct from multinational organisations such as \n humanitarian efforts.\n\nTruckers' convoys consisting of \n and/or \n are more similar to a \n than a military convoy.\n\nTruckers' convoys were created as a byproduct of the U.S.' \n and 18-wheelers becoming the prime targets of \n. Most truckers had difficult schedules to keep and as a result had to maintain a speed above the posted speed limit to reach their destinations on time. Convoys were started so that multiple trucks could run together at a high speed with the rationale being that if they passed a speed trap the police would only be able to pull over one of the trucks in the convoy. When driving on a highway, convoys are also useful to conserve fuel by \n.\n\nThe film \n, inspired by a 1975 \n, explores the camaraderie between \n, where the culture of the \n encourages truck drivers to travel in convoys.\n\nTruck convoys are sometimes organized for \n, \n, or promotional purposes. They can also be used as a form of \n, such as the \n in 2022.\n\nThe Highway Code of several European countries (Norway, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, possibly more) includes special rights for marked convoys. They have to be treated like a single vehicle. If the first vehicle has passed an intersection, all others may do so without interruption. If other road users overtake the convoy, they are not allowed to split into the queue. Clear and uniform marking has been required in court decisions for these rights to apply. Operating such convoy usually needs special permission, but there are exemptions for emergency and catastrophe intervention. Common practice is, to operate with the same style of marking as NATO convoys: \n 2154 marking plus country-specific augmentation listed in Annex B to the STANAG.\n\n\nDuring the \n with its high number of military exercises, the military was the main user of convoy rights. Today, catastrophes like large-scale flooding might bring a high number of flagged convoys to the roads. Large-scale evacuations for the disarming of World War II bombs are another common reason for \n (NGO) unit movements under convoy rights.\n\nIn Norway, \"convoy driving\" (\n: \n) is used during winter in case weather is too bad for vehicles to pass on their own. Convoy driving is initiated when the strong wind quickly fills the road with snow behind snowplows, particularly on mountain passes.\n Only a limited number of vehicles are allowed for each convoy and convoy leader is obliged to decline vehicles not fit for the drive.\n Storm convoys are prone to \n.\n Convoy driving is used through \n pass on \n during blizzards.\n Convoy is sometimes used on road E134 at the highest and most exposed sections during bad weather.\n On \n through \n pass convoy driving is often used when wind speed is over 15–20 m/s (\n) in winter conditions. During the winter of 1990 there was convoy driving for almost 500 hours at Saltfjellet\n\n"},

In some other countries, it is the sole or dominant language for historical reasons without being explicitly defined by law (such as in the United States or \n).\n It is a \n, the \n, and many other international and regional organisations. It has also become the \n \n language of \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and the \n.\n English accounts for at least 70% of total speakers of the Germanic language branch, and as of 2005\n, it was estimated that there were over two billion speakers worldwide.\n\n\n emerged from a group of West Germanic dialects spoken by the \n. Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from \n, a \n.\n Then, \n borrowed words extensively from \n, which make up about \n of Modern English vocabulary, and from \n, which also provides about \n.\n Thus, although most of its total vocabulary now comes from \n, its grammar, phonology, and most commonly-used words keep it \n classified under the Germanic branch. English exists on a \n with \n and then is most closely related to the \n and \n.\n\nEnglish is an \n and belongs to the \n group of the \n.\n \n \n from a Germanic tribal and \n along the \n \n coast, whose languages gradually evolved into the \n in the \n, and into the \n and \n/Low Saxon on the continent. The Frisian languages, which together with the Anglic languages form the \n, are the closest living relatives of English. Low German/Low Saxon is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the \n (Ingvaeonic) languages, though this grouping remains debated.\n Old English evolved into \n, which in turn evolved into Modern English.\n Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other Anglic languages, including \n and the extinct \n dialect and \n of \n.\n\n\nLike \n and \n, the development of English in the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and it has since diverged considerably. English is not \n with any continental Germanic language, differing in \n, \n, and \n, although some of these, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.\n\n\nUnlike Icelandic and Faroese, which were isolated, the development of English was influenced by a long series of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly \n and \n. These left a profound mark of their own on the language, so that English shows some similarities in vocabulary and grammar with many languages outside its linguistic \n—but it is not mutually intelligible with any of those languages either. Some scholars have argued that English can be considered a \n or a \n—a theory called the \n. Although the great influence of these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.\n\n\nEnglish is classified as a Germanic language because it shares \n with other Germanic languages such as \n, \n, and \n.\n These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called \n. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the division of verbs into \n and \n classes, the use of \n, and the sound changes affecting \n consonants, known as \n and \n. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the \n of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see \n).\n\n\nThe earliest varieties of an English language, collectively known as \n or \"Anglo-Saxon\", evolved from a group of \n dialects brought to Britain in the 5th century. Old English dialects were later influenced by \n-speaking \n \n, starting in the 8th and 9th centuries. \n began in the late 11th century after the \n of England, when a considerable amount of \n vocabulary, was incorporated into English over some three centuries.\n\n\n began in the late 15th century with the start of the \n and the \n trend of borrowing further \n and \n words and roots, concurrent with the introduction of the \n to \n. This era notably culminated in the \n and \n.\n The printing press greatly standardised English spelling,\n which has remained largely unchanged since then, despite a wide variety of later sound shifts in English dialects.\n\nModern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of the \n and the \n. Through all types of printed and electronic media in these countries, English has become the leading language of international \n and the \n in many regions and professional contexts such as science, \n, and law.\n Its \n is the result of a gradual change from a typical \n \n pattern with a rich \n \n and relatively \n to a mostly \n pattern with little inflection and a fairly fixed \n.\n Modern English relies more on \n and \n for the expression of complex \n, \n and \n, as well as \n, \n, and some \n.\n\nThe earliest form of English is called \n or Anglo-Saxon (\n). Old English developed from a set of \n dialects, often grouped as \n or \n, and originally spoken along the coasts of \n, \n and southern \n by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the \n, \n, and \n.\n From the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons \n as \n. By the 7th century, this Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons \n, replacing the languages of \n (43–409): \n, a \n, and \n, brought to Britain by the Roman occupation.\n At this time, these dialects generally resisted influence from the then-local Brittonic and Latin languages. \n and \n (originally \n and \n) are both named after the Angles.\n\n\nOld English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects (\n and \n) and the Saxon dialects (\n and \n).\n Through the educational reforms of \n in the 9th century and the influence of the kingdom of \n, the West Saxon dialect became the \n.\n The \n \n is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, \n, is written in Northumbrian.\n Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the \n developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a \n.\n By the 6th century, a \n was adopted, written with \n \n. It included the runic letters \n \n and \n \n, and the modified Latin letters \n \n, and \n \n.\n\n\nOld English is essentially a distinct language from Modern English and is virtually impossible for 21st-century unstudied English-speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern \n: \n had many more \n, and word order was \n than in Modern English. Modern English has \n in pronouns (\n, \n, \n) and has a few verb inflections (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more \n and \n endings.\n Its closest relative is \n, but even some centuries after the Anglo-Saxon migration, Old English retained considerable \n with other Germanic varieties. Even in the 9th and 10th centuries, amidst the \n and other \n invasions, there is historical evidence that Old Norse and Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility,\n although probably the northern dialects of Old English were more similar to Old Norse than the southern dialects. Theoretically, as late as the 900s AD, a commoner from certain (northern) parts of England could hold a conversation with a commoner from certain parts of Scandinavia. Research continues into the details of the myriad tribes in peoples in England and Scandinavia and the mutual contacts between them.\n\n\nThe translation of \n from 1000 shows examples of case endings (\n plural, \n plural, \n singular) and a verb ending (\n plural):\n\nFrom the 8th to the 11th centuries, Old English gradually \n through \n with \n in some regions. The waves of Norse (Viking) colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with \n, a \n language. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the \n area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in \n and \n. The centre of Norsified English was in the \n around \n. After 920 CE, when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, English spread extensively throughout the region.\n\nAn element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the third person pronoun group beginning with \n (\n) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with \n (\n).\n Other core \n include \"give\", \"get\", \"sky\", \"skirt\", \"egg\", and \"cake\", typically displacing a native Anglo-Saxon equivalent. Old Norse in this era retained considerable mutual intelligibility with some dialects of Old English, particularly northern ones.\n\nAlthough, from the beginning, Englishmen had three manners of speaking, southern, northern and midlands speech in the middle of the country, ... Nevertheless, through intermingling and mixing, first with Danes and then with Normans, amongst many the country language has arisen, and some use strange stammering, chattering, snarling, and grating gnashing.\n\nMiddle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the \n by \n in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200 to 1450.\n\nWith the Norman conquest of England in 1066, the now-Norsified Old English language was subject to another wave of intense contact, this time with \n, in particular \n. The Norman French spoken by the elite in England eventually developed into the \n.\n Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking English, the main influence of Norman was the introduction of a wide range of \n related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.\n Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating \n. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,\n and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.\n\n\nIn Wycliff'e Bible of the 1380s, the verse Matthew 8:20 was written: \n.\n Here the plural suffix \n on the verb \n is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present. By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and French features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes \n's \n, and \n's \n. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.\n\n\nThe next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the \n (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.\n\nThe Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a \n, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. \n and \n were \n, and \n were \n into \n. For example, the word \n was originally pronounced as the word \n is today, and the second vowel in the word \n was pronounced as the word \n is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.\n\n\nEnglish began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of \n. Around 1430, the \n in \n began using English in its \n, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as \n, developed from the dialects of London and the \n. In 1476, \n introduced the \n to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.\n Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of \n and the \n commissioned by \n. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the \n \n in \n, \n, and \n were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.\n\n\nIn the 1611 \n of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says, \"The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests.\"\n This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with subject–verb–object word order, and the use of \n instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (\n) and word replacements (\n originally meaning \"nestling\" had replaced OE \n).\n\n\nBy the late 18th century, the \n had spread English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.\n English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Oceania, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent \n that had multiple \n opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.\n In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a \n following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the \n and other broadcasters, caused the language to spread across the planet much faster.\n In the 21st century, English is more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.\n\n\nAs Modern English developed, explicit norms for standard usage were published, and spread through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 \n published his \n, which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, \n published the \n to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.\n\n\nIn modern English, the loss of grammatical case is almost complete (it is now only found in pronouns, such as \n and \n, \n and \n, \n and \n), and SVO word order is mostly fixed.\n Some changes, such as the use of \n, have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word \"do\" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.\n Now, do-support with the verb \n is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in \n, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as \n are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. \n instead of \n), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. \n instead of \n). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the United States as a world power.\n\n\nAs of 2016\n, 400 million people spoke English as their \n, and 1.1 billion spoke it as a secondary language.\n English is the \n. English is spoken by communities on every continent and on islands in all the major oceans.\n\n\nThe countries where English is spoken can be grouped into different categories according to how English is used in each country. The \"inner circle\"\n countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms for English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world.\n\nThe Indian linguist \n distinguished countries where English is spoken with a \n.\n In his model,\n\nKachru based his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.\n\n\nCountries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the \n (at least 231 million),\n the \n (60 million),\n \n (19 million),\n \n (at least 17 million),\n \n (4.8 million),\n \n (4.2 million), and \n (3.7 million).\n In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages and new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.\n The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.\n\n\nEstimates of the numbers of \n and foreign-language English speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1 billion, depending on how proficiency is defined.\n Linguist \n estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.\n In Kachru's three-circles model, the \"outer circle\" countries are countries such as the \n,\n \n,\n \n, \n, \n,\n \n and \n with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business, and its routine use for school instruction and official interactions with the government.\n\n\nThose countries have millions of native speakers of \n ranging from an \n to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English as they grow up through day-to-day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by non-native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.\n Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,\n and they may show grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.\n\n\nIn the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language, make up the \"expanding circle\".\n The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.\n For example, in the \n and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,\n and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the \"outer circle\" and \"expanding circle\". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.\n\n\nMany users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use the language.\n Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.\n Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries. This is particularly true of the shared vocabulary of mathematics and the sciences.\n\n\nPie chart showing the percentage of native English speakers living in \"inner circle\" English-speaking countries. Native speakers are now substantially outnumbered worldwide by second-language speakers of English (not counted in this chart).\n\nEnglish is a \n, which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.\n Spoken English, including English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their \n,\n but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international \n. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.\n\n\nAmerican listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.\n Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.\n\n\nThe settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce \n forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.\n The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,\n and English has been given official or co-official status by 30 of the 50 state governments, as well as all five territorial governments of the US, though there has never been an official language at the \n level.\n\n\nEnglish has ceased to be an \"English language\" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically \n.\n Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.\n Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an \"Afro-Saxon\" language community that unites Africans from different countries.\n\n\nAs decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.\n For example, the view of the \n among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.\n English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.\n However, English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.\n David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,\n but the number of English speakers in India is uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.\n\n\nModern English, sometimes described as the first global \n,\n is also regarded as the first \n.\n English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.\n English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required \n \n and Airspeak, used as \n of seafaring\n and aviation.\n English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.\n It achieved parity with \n as a language of diplomacy at the \n negotiations in 1919.\n By the time of the foundation of the \n at the end of \n, English had become pre-eminent\n and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.\n It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.\n Many other worldwide international organisations, including the \n, specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.\n\nMany regional international organisations such as the \n, \n (ASEAN),\n and \n (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.\n\n\nAlthough in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a \n.\n In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than Ireland and \n). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll (conducted when the UK was still a member of the EU), 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.\n\n\nA working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine\n and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by \n in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.\n\n\nInternational communities such as international business people may use English as an \n, with an emphasis on vocabulary suitable for their domain of interest. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. The trademarked \n uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words, designed to represent the highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar.\n Other examples include \n.\n\nThe increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about \n,\n and to claims of \n,\n and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.\n\n\nThough some mention a possibility of divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a \n language, in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.\n English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.\n Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any \n proposed as an \n, including \n.\n\n\nThe \n and \n of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of \n (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes.\n This overview mainly describes the \n of the \n and the \n: \n (RP) and \n (GA). (See \n, below.)\n\nThe phonetic symbols used below are from the \n (IPA).\n\n\nMost English dialects share the same 24\nconsonant phonemes. The consonant inventory shown below is valid for \n,\n and for RP.\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIn the table, when \n (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as \n, \n, and \n, the first is \n (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as \n are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as \n, and are always \n. Lenis consonants are partly \n at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as \n have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are \n \n when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often \n \n or pre-glottalised \n at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus \n has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than \n \n (\n).\n\n\nIn RP, the lateral approximant \n, has two main \n (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain \n, as in \n, and the dark or \n \n, as in \n.\n GA has dark \n in most cases.\n\n\nAll \n (liquids \n and nasals \n) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.\n\n\nThe pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel \n in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from \n compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.\n\n\nIn RP, vowel length is phonemic; \n are marked with a \n \n in the table above, such as the vowel of \n \n as opposed to \n \n. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.\n\nIn both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically \n in the same \n, like \n, but not before lenis consonants like \n or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of \n \n, \n \n, and \n \n are noticeably shorter than the vowels of \n \n, \n \n, and \n \n, and the vowel of \n \n is shorter than that of \n \n. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.\n\n\nThe vowel \n only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.\n Some dialects do not contrast \n and \n in unstressed positions, such that \n and \n rhyme and \n and \n are homophonous, a dialectal feature called the \n.\n GA \n and \n are realised as an \n \n, as in \n \n (phonemically \n), which in RP is realised as \n (phonemically \n).\n\n\nAn English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in \n \n, and end with up to five, as in (for some dialects) \n \n. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCCC), where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word \n \n is thus close to the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in \n; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in \n or \n; \n and a voiceless stop, as in \n; and \n, a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in \n.\n Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree in voicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Several consonants have limited distributions: \n can only occur in syllable-initial position, and \n only in syllable-final position.\n\n\n plays an important role in English. Certain \n are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently \n while vowels in stressed syllables are not.\n Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as \n, have \n depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.\n\nStress in English is \n, and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word \n is stressed on the first syllable (\n \n) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable (\n \n) for most meanings (for example, \"reduce in size\") when used as a verb.\n Here stress is connected to \n: in the noun \"contract\" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel \n, but in the verb \"contract\" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to \n. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. \n (\n) versus \n (\n), and \n (\n) versus \n (\n).\n\n\nIn terms of \n, English is generally described as a \n language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal.\n Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in \n: \n.\n\n\nVarieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best-known national varieties used as standards for education in non-English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as \n, \n, \n, \n and \n have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table \"Varieties of Standard English and their features\".\n\n\nEnglish has undergone many \n, some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the \n, which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the \n and \n have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.\n\n\nSome dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and \n than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a \n \n sound in \n that contrasts with the voiced \n in \n, but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced \n, a dialect feature called \n. The voiceless velar fricative sound \n is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes \n \n from \n \n. Accents like \n with \"\n\" lack the glottal fricative \n, and dialects with \n and \n like \n and \n do not have the dental fricatives \n, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops \n or labiodental fricatives \n.\n Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as \n, \n, and reduction of consonant clusters.\n\n\n and \n vary in their pronunciation of historical \n after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the \n). GA is a \n, meaning that it pronounces \n at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses \n in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide \n like RP or keep it like GA.\n\n\nThere is complex dialectal variation in words with the \n and \n \n. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three \n,\n and in Canadian English, they merge to two \n.\n In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table \"Dialects and open vowels\" shows this variation with \n in which these sounds occur.\n\nAs is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows \n \n. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional \n in favour of \n constructions. Only the \n retain morphological case more strongly than any other \n. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into \n and \n, and add the class of interjections.\n English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as \n and \n, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by \n, \n (fronting of question words beginning with \n-) and word order \n with some verbs.\n\n\nSome traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected \n stems inflected through \n (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs \n and \n) and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as \n, \n).\n Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (\n) and in the inflection of the \n verb \n.\n\n\nThe seven word-classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:\n\n\nEnglish nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into \n (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into \n and \n.\n\n\nMost count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural \n -\n, but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. \n, \n.\n\n\nRegular plural formation:\n\nIrregular plural formation:\n\nPossession can be expressed either by the possessive \n -\n (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition \n. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the \n possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -\n also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from a singular noun with an apostrophe. If the noun is plural formed with -s the apostrophe follows the -s.\n\n\nPossessive constructions:\n\nNouns can form \n (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.\n Noun phrases can be short, such as \n, composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. \n, \n, \n) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. \n, \n). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as \n, or prepositions such as \n, e.g. \n (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.\n For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in \n, where the enclitic follows \n and not \n.\n\nThe class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of \n, where \n marks a definite noun and \n or \n an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include \n, \n, \n and \n, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. \n (sg.) but \n (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.\n\n\nEnglish adjectives are words such as \n, \n, \n and \n that most typically modify nouns, \n characteristics of their \n (e.g., \n). As modifiers, they come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.\n English adjectives also function as predicative complements (e.g., \n).\n\nIn Modern English, adjectives are not inflected so as to \n in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases \n, and \n, the adjective \n does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.\n\nSome adjectives are inflected for \n, with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix \n marking the comparative, and \n marking the superlative: \n, \n, \n. Some adjectives have irregular \n comparative and superlative forms, such as \n, \n, and \n. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by \n, with the adverb \n marking the comparative, and \n marking the superlative: \n or \n, \n or \n.\n There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.\n\n\nEnglish determiners are words such as \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n, occurring most typically in noun phrases before the head nouns and any modifiers and marking the noun phrase as \n or indefinite.\n They often agree with the noun in \n. They do not typically inflect for degree of comparison.\n\nEnglish pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (\n) as well as an animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing \n from the three sets of animate third person singular pronouns) and an optional gender distinction in the animate third person singular (distinguishing between \n [feminine], \n [\n], and \n [masculine]).\n The \n corresponds to the Old English \n, and the \n is used in the sense both of the previous \n (for a patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and of the Old English dative case (for a recipient or \n of a transitive verb).\n The subjective is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, otherwise the objective is used.\n While grammarians such as \n and \n noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin-based system, some contemporary grammars, for example \n, retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.\n\nPossessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in \n), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. \n).\n The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old second person singular familiar pronoun \n acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned).\n\nBoth the second and third persons share pronouns between the plural and singular:\n\nPronouns are used to refer to entities \n or \n. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation—for example, the pronoun \n identifies the speaker, and the pronoun \n, the addressee. Anaphoric pronouns such as \n refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence \n. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. \"he sent it to himself\" or \"she braced herself for impact\").\n\n\nPrepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. \n, \n, \n, \n.\n Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs.\n For example, in the phrase \n, the preposition \n marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb \n. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, \"with her\", \"to me\", \"for us\". But some contemporary grammars such as that of \n:598–600) no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.\n\n\nEnglish verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb \n is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.\n Auxiliary verbs such as \n and \n are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form \n tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.\n\n\nMost verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.\n The copula verb \n is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is \n, the third person singular form is \n, and the form \n is used in the second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is \n and its gerund-participle is \n.\n\nEnglish has two primary tenses, past (preterite) and non-past. The preterite is inflected by using the preterite form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix \n, and for the strong verbs either the suffix \n or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix \n.\n\n\nEnglish does not have future verb forms.\n The future tense is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs \n or \n.\n Many varieties also use a \n constructed with the \n \n (\"\n\").\n\n\nFurther aspectual distinctions are shown by auxiliary verbs, primarily \n and \n, which show the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (\n vs. \n), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (\n) and present perfect (\n).\n\n\nFor the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as \n, \n, \n, \n and the past tense forms \n, \n, \n, \n. There are also \n and \n, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular \n), for use in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: \n; imperative \n).\n\n\nAn infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition \n, is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterite form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause.\n For example, \n where only the auxiliary verb \n is inflected for time and the main verb \n is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as \n, where the main verb is \n, which is in a preterite form, and \n is in the infinitive.\n\nEnglish also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called \n, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle that follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly \n meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. \n meaning \n).\n In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including \n:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term \"phrasal verb\". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. \n and \n are syntactically equivalent.\n\nThe function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs.\n Many adverbs are derived from adjectives by appending the suffix \n. For example, in the phrase \n, the adverb \n is derived in this way from the adjective \n. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as \n, which has the adverbial form \n.\n\nModern English syntax language is moderately \n.\n It has developed features such as \n and \n as resources for conveying meaning. \n mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the \n and progressive \n.\n\nEnglish word order has moved from the Germanic \n to being almost exclusively \n (SVO).\n The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as \n.\n\nIn most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.\n The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent are marked only by the position relative to the verb:\n\nAn exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form.\n The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject are represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:\n\n (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as \n or in a prepositional phrase, such as \n.\n\n\nIn English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, there is always at least one main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to a main clause. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase \n, the main clause is headed by the verb \n, the subject is \n, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause \n. The subordinating conjunction \n shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.\n \n are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence \n, the relative clause \n specifies the meaning of the word \n, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns \n, \n, \n and \n as well as by \n (which can also be omitted.)\n In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.\n\n\nEnglish syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence \n, the clause \n is the complement of the negated verb \n. \n is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.\n\nThe verb \n can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I \n shut the fridge.\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English \n permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. \n does not allow the addition of the negating adverb \n to an ordinary \n lexical verb, as in \n—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or \n) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary \n is used, to produce a form like \n The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say \n; grammatical rules require \n\n\nNegation is done with the adverb \n, which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not \n can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb \n. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English \n is the correct answer to the question \n, but not \n, although this construction may be found in older English.\n\n\nPassive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb \n or \n, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with \n. For example, putting the sentence \n into the passive becomes \n, or \n.\n\n\nBoth \n and \n in English are mostly formed using \n (\n, \n), which may require \n (\n, \n). In most cases, \n (\n-words; e.g. \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n) appear in a \n. For example, in the question \n, the word \n appears as the first constituent despite being the \n of the sentence. (When the \n-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: \n.) \n can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. \n. The personal interrogative pronoun \n is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant \n serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.\n\n\nWhile English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a \n structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, \n. Another way is through a \n where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a \n such as \n or \n, e.g. \n, \n.\n Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., \n) or in existential clauses (\n). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.\n\n emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, \n (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or \n (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).\n Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, \n, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, \n, where reference to the girl is established as an \"afterthought\".\n\n\n between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as \n (e.g. \n where \n refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or \n used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).\n \n such as \n, \n or \n, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for \n in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, \n (the idiomatic marker \n expressing disbelief), or \n (the marker \n expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.\n\n\nIt is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if \n are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the \n from 1989.\n Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million words—but that count presumably includes words such as Latin \n, \n, \n, \n and \n words, \n, foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical \n.\n\n\nDue to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by \n, the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality \n,\n collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analyses of linguistic corpus data become available.\n\n\nEnglish forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,\n using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,\n producing compound words such as \n or \n or \n.\n A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (\n, \n, \n, \n) to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of \n or \n).\n\nFormation of new words, called \n, based on \n (for example \n or \n) is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, American lexicographer \n attributed many such words to the \"\n\" (ISV) when compiling \n (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is the creation of \n,\n words formed by pronouncing abbreviations of longer phrases as single words, e.g. \n, \n, \n.\n\nSource languages of the English vocabulary\n\n\nEnglish, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This borrowing is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.\n Nevertheless, most of the core vocabulary and the most common words in English are still West Germanic.\n The English words first learned by children as they learn to speak are mainly Germanic words from \n.\n It is not possible to speak or write English without Germanic words, but it is possible to write or speak many sentences in English without foreign loanwords.\n\n\nBut one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of \"Latinate\" words (derived from French, especially, and also from other Romance languages and Latin). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.\n Linguist Anthony Lacoudre estimated that over 40,000 English words are of French origin and may be understood without \n change by French speakers.\n Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and \n. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as \n and \n.\n\n\nEnglish has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.\n Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.\n English continues to gain new loanwords and \n (\"loan translations\") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.\n\n\nEnglish has formal and informal \n; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.\n\n\nEnglish has had a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.\n The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world \n, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.\n That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.\n Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as \n, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.\n Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.\n\n\nSince the ninth century, English has been written in a \n (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in \n are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.\n The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the \n: \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n (which also have \n forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).\n\nThe spelling system, or \n, of English is multi-layered and complex, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.\n Further complications have arisen through \n with which the orthography has not kept pace.\n Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.\n There are also systematic \n. These situations have prompted \n.\n\n\nAlthough letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.\n Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling—for example, the words \n, \n, and \n,\n or the words \n and \n. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is \"near-optimal\",\n there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.\n The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.\n Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.\n\n\nReaders of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or \n used to spell consonant sounds. The letters \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n represent, respectively, the phonemes \n. The letters \n and \n normally represent \n and \n, but there is also a \n pronounced \n, and a \n pronounced \n. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters \n and \n are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include \n for \n, \n for \n, \n for \n or \n, \n for \n, \n for \n, and \n for \n in Greek-derived words. The single letter \n is generally pronounced as \n in word-initial position and as \n otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin\n or residues of proposals by scholars in the early period of Modern English to follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.\n\n\nFor the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n). As a result, some \"\n\" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the \n in \n, the \n in \n, and the \n in \n), or the historically based \n (as in \n and \n).\n\n\nThe consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read and write can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.\n Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.\n Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.\n Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.\n\n\nEnglish writing also includes a system of \n marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.\n\n\nDialectologists identify many \n, which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate \n. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of \n (BrE) and \n (NAE).\n There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being \n and \n.\n\nThe fact that English has been spoken in England for 1,500 years explains why England has a great wealth of regional dialects.\n Within the United Kingdom, \n (RP), an educated accent associated originally with the \n, has been traditionally used as a broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of British accents. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the 1950-61 \n, grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.\n\n\nNonetheless, this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary. In fact, only 3% of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking in regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.\n There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.\n Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class; some traits, though exceedingly common, are nonetheless considered \"non-standard\" and associated with lower-class speakers and identities. An example of this is \n, which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England. However, it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.\n\n\n can be divided into four major dialect regions: South East English, South West English (also known as \n), Midlands English and \n. Within each of these regions, several local dialects exist: within the Northern region, there is a division between the \n dialects, the \n dialect (spoken around \n, in \n) and the \n dialects, which include the urban subdialects of \n (\n) and \n (\n). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking invasions of England, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.\n\n\nSince the 15th century, South East England varieties have centred on London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the \n dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the South East led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had been influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.\n Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of \n (\n is pronounced \n \n), \n (\n is pronounced with a glottal stop as \n \n) and \n, or the pronunciation of \n as \n (\n pronounced \n) or \n (\n pronounced \n).\n\n\n is today considered a separate language from English, but it has \n in early Northern Middle English\n and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly \n and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. In addition to Scots, \n comprises the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland; most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.\n\n\nIn \n, various forms of English have been spoken since the \n of the 11th century. In \n and in the area surrounding \n, two extinct dialects known as \n and \n developed as offshoots from Early Middle English and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern \n, however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into \n, the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, and various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the \n which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.\n\n\n is generally homogeneous compared to \n, but this has been disputed.\n American accent variation is increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,\n though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,\n known collectively as \n (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves, including \n and \n.\n In most American and Canadian English dialects, \n (or \n-fulness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (or \n-dropping) being associated with lower prestige and social class, especially since the end of \n. This contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.\n\n\nThe English language is far and away the most widely used in the \n. Its roots trace back to the \n, which began with the settlement in present-day \n in 1607. While \n was the predominant language among \n immigrants, who arrived primarily in eastern \n, English was ultimately widely adopted throughout the \n that ultimately launched both the \n and \n against the \n, then ruled by \n and establishing the United States as an independent sovereign nation in September 1783.\n\nSeparate from General American English are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems that have developed over time, including \n, the English of the coastal \n—including \n and \n—and \n; all of these, aside from certain subdialects of the American South, were historically non-rhotic. \n varieties, except for those of the \n and perhaps \n, are generally considered to fall under the General American English continuum, although they often show \n of the vowels \n and \n before \n and have distinct norms for writing and pronunciation as well.\n\n\nIn \n, the most populous American \"accent group\" outside of General American English,\n rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's \n.\n Southern accents are colloquially described as a \"drawl\" or \"twang\",\n being recognised most readily by the Southern Vowel Shift initiated by \n in the \n vowel (e.g. pronouncing \n almost like \n), the \"Southern breaking\" of several front pure vowels into a gliding vowel or even two syllables (e.g. pronouncing the word \"press\" almost like \"pray-us\"),\n the \n, and other distinctive phonological, grammatical, and lexical features, many of which are actually recent developments of the 19th century or later.\n\n\nSpoken primarily by working- and middle-class \n, \n (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard \n. A minority of linguists,\n contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a \n or \n to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.\n AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of \"broken\" or \"uneducated\" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by large speech communities.\n\n\nSince 1788, English has been spoken in \n, and \n has developed as the first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being \n. The \n has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.\n Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by \n and the English of South East England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the \n of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely with British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in \n rather than \n).\n New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.\n\n\nThe first significant exposure of the \n to the English language occurred in 1762 when the \n during the \n, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946 and remains an official language of the Philippines. Today, the use of English is ubiquitous in the Philippines, being found on \n and marquees, in government documents and forms, in courtrooms, in the media and entertainment industries, in the business sector, and in various other aspects of daily life.\n One particularly prominent form of English usage in the country is found in everyday speech: most \n from \n use or, at the very least, have been exposed to \n, a form of code-switching between \n and English.\n A similar code-switching method is used by urban native speakers of \n under the name of \n.\n\nEnglish is spoken widely in southern Africa and is an official or co-official language in several of the region's countries. In \n, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with \n and various African languages such as the \n and \n. Today, about nine percent of the South African population speaks \n (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety that tends to follow RP as a norm. It is one of the few non-rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R. The second-language varieties of South Africa differ based on the native languages of their speakers.\n Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.\n Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce \n without aspiration (e.g. \n pronounced \n rather than as \n as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap \n instead of as the more common fricative.\n\n\nNigerian English is a variety of English spoken in \n.\n It has traditionally been based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the variety out of a need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. \n). Over 150 million Nigerians speak English.\n\n\nSeveral varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, the \n and \n and \n, \n, the \n and \n. Each of these areas is home both to a local variety of English and a local English-based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are \n and \n. In Central America, English-based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.\n Locals are often fluent in both the local English variety and the local creole languages, and \n between them is frequent. Indeed, a way to conceptualise the relationship between such creole and standard varieties is to view them as a spectrum of language registers in which the most creole-like forms serve as the \"basilect\" and the most RP-like forms serve as the \"acrolect\", the most formal register.\n\n\nMost Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs \n and \n are monophthongs \n and \n or even the reverse diphthongs \n and \n (e.g. \n and \n pronounced \n and \n). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that \"child\" is pronounced \n and \"wind\" \n.\n\n\nAs a historical legacy, \n tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as \n and \n (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as \n and \n) and the replacement of \n and \n with dentals \n and \n. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling-based pronunciations where the silent \n found in words such as \n is pronounced as an Indian \n stop \n.\n\n\n may pronounce words differently due to having not fully mastered \n. This can happen either because they apply the \n of their mother tongue to English (\"interference\") or through implementing strategies similar to those used in \n.\n They may create innovative pronunciations for English sounds, not found in the speaker's first language.\n\n"},

The convoy left \n on 17 April 1944, carrying two \n \n to reinforce Japan's defensive positions in the \n and \n. \n (USN) \n attacked the convoy on 26 April and 6 May, sinking four transports and killing more than 4,000 soldiers. These losses caused the convoy to be diverted to \n, where the surviving soldiers and their equipment were unloaded.\n\nThe \n convoy's losses had important strategic results. The failure to bring the two divisions to their destination without loss contributed to the Japanese \n' decision to move Japan's defensive perimeter back by 1,000 km (600 mi). The divisions' combat power was also blunted by their losses, and while they both saw action against \n forces, they contributed little to Japan's war effort.\n\nIn September 1943, the \n (IJN) and \n (IJA) agreed to establish defensive positions along what was termed Japan's \"absolute zone of national defense\". The zone's perimeter reached from the \n and \n to western \n and the \n and \n.\n At this time there were few Army units in the area, and it was decided to move combat units from \n and \n to protect the airfields which were the basis of Japan's defensive plans. The movement of these troops was delayed by shipping shortages, however.\n Efforts to reinforce the Marianas and Caroline islands were assigned the highest priority. The units selected for western New Guinea remained in China until April 1944 when ships became available to transport them.\n\n\nBy early 1944, Allied submarines \n of Japanese ships. Their activities were frequently guided by '\n' intelligence relating to ship movements which was collected by intercepting and decrypting encoded radio transmissions. The IJN routinely broadcast the location and intended route of convoys under its protection and decrypting these messages allowed Allied naval commanders to alert submarines in the vicinity of convoys. The submarine commanders were free to plan their interception and attack where conditions were most favorable.\n\n\nThe IJN's faulty \n doctrine also contributed to Japan's shipping losses. The Navy had placed a low priority on protecting merchant shipping from submarine attack before and during the early years of the war and convoys were not routinely assembled until 1943.\n The Grand Escort Headquarters was formed in late 1943 to coordinate convoys and implement a standard doctrine. The Escort-of-Convoy headquarters was also established in April 1944 to provide a pool of senior commanders who were available to command convoys, though none had any experience with convoy operations or anti-submarine warfare.\n\n\nAttacks on merchant shipping during February 1944 led the Japanese to change the composition of their convoys. During this month, over ten percent of the Japanese merchant marine was sunk by submarines and air attack.\n These losses included several transport ships carrying reinforcements to the Marianas and Carolines.\n In response, the Grand Escort Fleet Headquarters increased the average size of Japanese convoys from five ships to \"large\" convoys of ten to twenty vessels. This change allowed the IJN to allocate more escort ships to each convoy and it was hoped that conducting fewer convoys would also reduce the number of targets available to submarines. While Japanese officers attributed a drop in sinkings during March to the changed tactics, this was actually due to the \n's submarines being diverted to support raids conducted by the \n that month.\n\n\nThe \n convoy was assembled at Shanghai in April 1944. Its task was to carry the \n to \n and the main body of the \n to western New Guinea.\n Both divisions had been formed in 1939 and were veterans of fighting in China during the \n.\n One of the 35th Division's three infantry \n was detached from the division in early April and sent to the \n, arriving there later that month without loss.\n\n\nThe two divisions embarked on large transport ships protected by an unusually strong escort force.\n \n \n—who was a veteran of several previous operations, including the \n—was appointed to command the convoy.\n The escort force was the newly established 6th Escort Convoy Command and included Kajioka's flagship, the coal burning \n \n, as well as \n \n, \n and \n,  ocean escort ships ('\n') \n, \n and \n, minesweeper \n, \n \n and \n and \n \n, \n and \n.\n\n\nThe \n convoy sailed from Shanghai bound for \n on 17 April,\n and initially comprised 15 transports and the 6th Escort Convoy Command. Seven of the transports were traveling to Manila only and the 32nd and 35th Divisions were each carried by four vessels.\n Allied code breakers decrypted radio signals relating to the convoy's departure and subsequent intercepts allowed \n to follow its progress south.\n\n\nIntelligence from the intercepted radio signals was used to guide the submarine \n toward the convoy, and she made contact with it off the northwest coast of \n on the morning of 26 April.\n The submarine's captain—\n (later Rear Admiral) Tommy Dykers—attempted to maneuver into a position to attack the convoy but lost contact when he was forced to evade a Japanese submarine. An aircraft sighted and attacked \n a few minutes later, but the convoy did not change course. Dykers regained contact at midday after sighting \ns heavy smoke exhaust and surfaced an hour before sunset to get into an attack position. He was forced to submerge, however, when another aircraft attacked the submarine.\n\n\n surfaced again after dark, and successfully attacked after the moon set. Dykers found that the Japanese escorts were alert, and was unable to penetrate the convoy. As a result, he attacked three times by firing a total of 19 \n from long range into the mass of ships at the center of the convoy.\n These attacks sank the 5,425-\n freighter \n, which was carrying an entire regiment of the 32nd Division. All 3,000 soldiers onboard drowned when the ship sank quickly.\n The remaining Japanese ships continued to Manila, arriving there on 29 April.\n\n\nThe 32nd Division's destination changed during the voyage from Shanghai to Manila. Imperial General Headquarters was concerned that the increasing difficulty of shipping units towards the front line meant that it would not be possible to complete the planned reinforcement of the \"absolute zone of national defense\" before Allied forces reached the area. As a result, it was decided to use the division to reinforce the \n in western New Guinea and the eastern \n (NEI)—which were under direct threat of attack—rather than send it to Mindanao.\n\n\nThe \n convoy resumed its journey to New Guinea on 1 May. Its composition was now eight transports (one of the Manila-bound transports having replaced \n) under the protection of \n, \n, \n, minesweeper \n, \n and \n.\n The convoy took a special route planned by the Third Southern Expeditionary Fleet to reduce the risk of submarine attack.\n\n\nU.S. signals intelligence operators again detected the convoy's departure. On 2 May, analysts estimated its size as nine transports and seven escorts carrying 12,784 troops of the 32nd Division and an unknown number of men from the 35th Division. Decoded Japanese Army Water Transport Code messages also provided the Allies with the convoy's route, speed, daily noon positions and destination. This \"extraordinary intelligence coup\" was passed to the relevant commands on 2 May and the USN positioned submarines to ambush the Japanese ships.\n\n\nThe \n convoy suffered a devastating submarine attack on 6 May. On that day, \n intercepted the Japanese ships in the \n near the northeastern tip of \n. \ns captain—Commander Herb Andrews—submerged his boat and made a cautious approach to avoid detection by aircraft. He reached a firing position four hours later and fired six torpedoes at two transports. Only one of these torpedoes struck its mark, and a second salvo missed its intended targets but hit another transport. Andrews then turned his boat and fired further torpedoes from \ns stern \n which hit a third transport. One of the Japanese destroyers counterattacked \n and forced Andrews to break off his attack.\n The destroyer was traveling at too great a speed for its detection gear to function, however, and did not damage the submarine, despite dropping approximately 100 \n.\n\n\n rose to \n two hours later and found that a major effort to rescue troops and equipment from the torpedoed transports was under way. That night, the submarine torpedoed one of the crippled transports which was still afloat. \ns attack sank transports \n (5,825 tons) and \n (6,995 tons) as well as the cargo ship \n (6,886 tons).\n While the rescue effort was relatively successful, 1,290 troops were killed and much of their equipment was lost.\n\n\nDue to its heavy losses, the \n convoy was ordered to dock at Halmahera in the eastern NEI rather than continue to New Guinea. The surviving ships arrived there on 9 May.\n Both divisions and their equipment were unloaded and the convoy sailed for Manila on 13 May, arriving on 20 May without further loss.\n\n\nThe attacks on the \n convoy blunted the 32nd and 35th Divisions' fighting power. The 32nd Division's combat elements were reduced from nine to five infantry \n and from four to one and a half \n battalions.\n Only four of the six 35th Division infantry battalions which sailed in the convoy reached Halmahera and much of the division's artillery was lost.\n\n\nThe loss of the Take Ichi convoy greatly assisted U.S. Army General \n's double invasions of \n and \n on 22 April 1944, hundreds of miles to the west of the previous battle line in \n. MacArthur's forces were able to rapidly advance westward with minimal casualties within the next five months all the way to \n, just a short distance from Halmahera, partly as a result of the failure by these Japanese troops to be able to reach most of western New Guinea.\n\n\nThe destruction of the Take Ichi convoy also forced the Japanese leadership to acknowledge that it was no longer possible to reinforce or defend most of western New Guinea. While the \n's commander \n \n requested that the surviving ships attempt to carry the 35th Division to New Guinea, this was rejected by Imperial General Headquarters. The losses inflicted on the convoy also contributed to the Imperial General Headquarters' decision to move the perimeter of the \"absolute zone of national defense\" back to a line extending from \n to Halmahera.\n This represented a 1,000 km (600 mi) strategic withdrawal from the perimeter which had been planned in March.\n\n\nJapanese naval staff officers gathered in Manila in June to analyze the \n convoy. The officers believed that Japan's communication codes were secure and discussed alternative explanations for the convoy's detection. These explanations included the increase in radio signals at the time the convoy sailed being detected by Allied radio traffic analysts, a Japanese officer in Manila accidentally divulging information and Allied spies working on the Manila waterfront radioing messages about the convoy's composition and departure. The meeting concluded that Allied spies were responsible for the convoy's detection, and the Japanese military's codes were not changed.\n\n\nSome of the surviving elements of the 32nd and 35th Divisions later saw action against American forces. The 35th Division was moved forward from Halmahera to Sorong in small ships during May.\n The regiment which had been sent to the Palaus in April was also successfully transferred to New Guinea.\n Elements of the 35th Division subsequently fought in the Battles of \n and \n, but most of the division was stationed on the \n, where it was isolated from September 1944.\n The 32nd Division was retained at Halmahera to garrison the island.\n Much of the division later saw action on the neighboring island of \n, where it suffered heavy losses while \n which had established a base there during September and October 1944.\n\n"},
{"title": "Halmahera - Wikipedia", "content": ", formerly known as \n, \n, or \n, is the largest \n in the \n. It is part of the \n \n of \n, and \n, the capital of the province, is located on the west coast of the island.\n\nHalmahera has a land area of 17,780 km\n (6,860 sq mi);\n it is the largest island of Indonesia outside the five main islands. It had a population of 162,728 in 1995; by 2010, it had increased to 449,938 for the island itself (excluding the tip which is considered part of the Joronga Islands, but including \n and Ju islands) and 667,161 for the island group (including all of South Halmahera and \n, but not \n).\n Approximately half of the island's inhabitants are \n and half are \n.\n\nSparsely-populated Halmahera's fortunes have long been closely tied to those of the smaller islands of \n and \n, both off its west coast. These islands were both the sites of major kingdoms in the era before \n \n the entire archipelago.\n\nDuring \n, Halmahera was the site of a \n naval base at \n Bay.\n\nIn 1999 and 2000, Halmahera was the site of violence that began as a purely ethnic dispute between residents of (mainly Christian) \n and (entirely Muslim) \n sub-districts and then took on a religious nature as it spread through much of the North Moluccas, called the \n. Thousands of people on Halmahera were killed in the fighting between religious militias. In June 2000, about five hundred people were killed when a \n carrying \n from the fighting on Halmahera sank off the northeast tip of \n island. Conspiracy theories about this event abound. A memorial to this tragedy can be found in Duma village in North Halmahera district.\n\nToday, much transportation to the rest of Indonesia is through connections on the provincial capital, \n island although \n, the largest town on Halmahera, also has direct ferry and cargo sea links to \n and \n.\n\n\nParticularly, since the inauguration of the first ever directly elected \n (Regent or District Head), Tobelo is undergoing rapid development and is aiming at rivaling Ternate's historical dominance.\n As it is surrounded by flat land, Tobelo has the potential for expansion.\n Ternate is limited by its size, being a small island which can be driven around in forty-five minutes.

{"title": "Division (military) - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\nA \n is a large \n or \n, usually consisting of between 10,000 and 25,000 soldiers. In most armies, a division is composed of several \n or \n; in turn, several divisions typically make up a \n.\n\nHistorically, the division has been the default \n unit capable of independent \n. Smaller combined arms units, such as the American \n (RCT) during World War II, were used when conditions favored them. In recent times, modern Western militaries have begun adopting the smaller \n (similar to the RCT) as the default combined arms unit, with the division they belong to being less important.\n\nA similar word, \n, is also used in languages such as Russian, Serbian, Croatian and Polish, for a \n-size artillery or cavalry unit. In naval usage \"\n\" has a completely different range of meanings.  Aboard ships of British Royal Navy tradition, the terms \"division\" or \"department\" are often used interchangeably and refer to the administrative organization used to manage personnel. Aboard US navy ships (including US coastguard vessels), in shore commands and in US naval aviation units (including US navy, marine corps, and coastguard aviation) it refers to an administrative/functional sub-unit of a department (e.g., fire control division of the weapons department).  Alternatively it refers to a sub-unit of several ships within a \n or \n, or to two or three sections of aircraft operating under a designated division leader.\n\nIn the West, the first general to think of organizing an army into smaller combined-arms units was \n (d. 1750), \n, in his book \n. He died at the age of 54, without having implemented his idea. \n put the ideas into practice. He conducted successful practical experiments of the divisional system in the \n.\n\nThe first war in which the divisional system was used systematically was the \n. \n of the \n, who was in charge of military affairs, came to the same conclusion about it as the previous royal government, and the army was organised into divisions.\n\nIt made the armies more flexible and easy to maneuver, and it also made the large \n manageable. Under \n, the divisions were grouped together into \n, because of their increasing size. Napoleon's military success spread the divisional and corps system all over Europe; by the end of the \n, all armies in Europe had adopted it.\n\nThe composition of divisions varied significantly during the two world wars and, in addition, there was no uniformity of quality, even when divisions had the same composition.\n\nThe size of infantry divisions deployed by the major belligerents at start of the Great War ranged from about 16,000 in the French\n and Russian armies to 17,500 in the German imperial army\n and about 18,000 in Austro-Hungarian\n and British armies.\n\n\nAs World War I went on, the size of divisions decreased significantly from those of 1914, with both British and Germans reducing the number of divisions' sub-units.\n But, while the number of soldiers was lower, by 1917, divisions were much better armed.\n\n\nOn the other hand, in 1917, the American infantry divisions that arrived in France numbered 28,061 officers and men, of which 17,666 were riflemen.\n\n\nThe divisional system reached its numerical height during the \n. Beside the infantry and cavalry divisions created since Napoleonic era, new division types appeared during the Second World War, such as airborne, tank, mechanized, motorized.\n\nThe Soviet Union's \n consisted of more than a thousand division-sized units at any one time, and the number of rifle divisions raised during the \n of 1941–1945 is estimated\n at 2,000. \n had hundreds of numbered or named divisions, while the United States employed up to 91 divisions.\n\nA notable change to divisional structures during the war was completion of the shift from \n (composed of two brigades each with two regiments) to \n (composed of three regiments with no brigade level) that many European armies had started using in \n.\n  This was done to increase flexibility and to pare down chain-of-command overhead. The triangular division structure allowed the tactic of \"two forward, one back\", where two of the division's regiments could engage the enemy with one regiment in reserve.\n\nAll divisions in World War II were expected to have their own artillery formations, usually (depending upon the nation) the size of a regiment. Divisional artillery was occasionally seconded by corps-level command to increase firepower in larger engagements.\n\nDuring the war the US also used \n, whereby attached and/or organic divisional units were parceled out to infantry regiments, creating smaller combined-arms units with their own armor and artillery and support units. These combat teams would still be under divisional command but had some level of autonomy on the battlefield.\n\n units within divisions were units which operated directly under divisional command and were not normally controlled by the regiments. These units were mainly support units in nature, and included signal companies, medical battalions, supply trains and administration.\n\n\n units were smaller units that were placed under divisional command temporarily for the purpose of completing a particular mission. These units were usually combat units such as tank battalions, tank-destroyer battalions or cavalry-reconnaissance squadrons.\n\nIn modern times, most military forces have standardized their divisional structures. This does not mean that divisions are equal in size or structure from country to country, but divisions have, in most cases, come to be units of 10,000 to 15,000 soldiers with enough organic support to be capable of independent operations. Usually, the direct organization of the division consists of one to four \n or \n of its primary combat arm, along with a brigade or regiment of combat support (usually \n) and a number of direct-reporting \n for necessary specialized support tasks, such as \n, \n, \n, and \n. Most militaries standardize ideal organization strength for each type of division, encapsulated in a \n (TO&E) which specifies exact assignments of units, personnel, and equipment for a division.\n\nThe modern division became the primary identifiable combat unit in many militaries during the second half of the 20th century, supplanting the \n; however, the trend started to reverse since the end of the \n. The peak use of the division as the primary combat unit occurred during \n, when the belligerents deployed over a thousand divisions. With technological advances since then, the combat power of each division has increased.\n\nDivisions are often formed to organize units of a particular type together with appropriate support units to allow independent operations. In more recent times, divisions have mainly been organized as \n units with \n units representing various combat arms. In this case, the division often retains the name of a more specialized division, and may still be tasked with a primary role suited to that specialization.\n\nAn \"infantry division\" is a military formation composed primarily of \n \n, also supported by units from other \n. In the \n and Russia, an infantry division is often referred to as a \"rifle division\". A \"\n\" division is a division with a majority of infantry subunits transported on \n. A \"\n\" division is a division with a majority of infantry subunits transported on \n (APCs) or \n (IFVs) or both, or even some other class of \n designed for the transportation of infantry. Mechanized infantry divisions in Nazi Germany were called \"\n divisions\". In Russia, they were known as \"motor rifle divisions\".\n\nBecause of the ease and simplicity involved in forming divisions of infantry compared to other formations, infantry divisions have often been the most numerous in historical warfare. Most \n were infantry divisions.\n\nInfantry divisions were also expected to travel by foot from place to place, with transport vehicles or pack horses used to augment their travel. Divisions evolved over the course of time. For instance, in 1944, Nazi Germany designated some of their infantry formations as \n divisions, which were slightly smaller than the regular divisions, with wider issue of sub-machine guns, automatic and anti-tank weapons to reflect the reality that they were to be used in defensive warfare. In 1945, Nazi Germany seconded members of the \n to create \"naval divisions\", which were of lower quality than the infantry divisions of the \n. They also created \"\n field divisions\" from members of the \n.\n\nInfantry divisions were sometimes given the responsibility of \n work. These were named \"frontier guard divisions\", \"static infantry divisions\" and \"fortress divisions\", and were used often by Nazi Germany. The Soviet Union organised Machine-Gun Artillery Divisions of artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and static gun positions for use East of the Urals. A 1997 report said they were generally composed of four brigades, though later data suggests this was inaccurate.\n\n\nFor most nations, \n was deployed in smaller units and was not therefore organized into divisions, but for larger militaries, such as that of the \n, United States, \n, France, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n, a number of cavalry divisions were formed. They were most often similar to the nations' infantry divisions in structure, although they usually had fewer and lighter support elements, with cavalry brigades or regiments replacing the infantry units, and supporting units, such as artillery and supply, being horse-drawn. For the most part, large cavalry units did not remain after \n.\n\nWhile horse cavalry had been found to be obsolete, the concept of cavalry as a fast force capable of missions traditionally fulfilled by horse cavalry made a return to military thinking during the Cold War. In general, two new types of cavalry were developed: \n or airmobile, relying on helicopter mobility, and \n, based on an autonomous armored formation. The former was pioneered by the \n, formed on 1 February 1963 at \n, Georgia. On 29 June 1965, the division was renamed the \n, before its departure for the \n.\n\nAfter the end of the Vietnam War, the \n was reorganised and re-equipped with tanks and armored scout vehicles to form armored cavalry.\n\nThe concept of a fast-moving, armored reconnaissance force has remained in modern armies, but these units are now smaller and make up a combined arms force used in modern brigades and divisions, and are no longer granted divisional status.\n\n\"Light divisions\" were German horse cavalry divisions organized early in World War II which included motorized units.\n\nThe development of the \n during \n prompted some nations to experiment with forming them into division-size units. Many did this the same way as they did cavalry divisions, by merely replacing cavalry with \n (including tanks) and motorizing the supporting units. This proved unwieldy in combat, as the units had many tanks but few infantry units. Instead, a more balanced approach was taken by adjusting the number of tank, infantry, artillery, and support units.\n\nThe terms \"tank division\" or \"mechanized division\" are alternative names for armored divisions. A \"\n\" was an armoured division of the \n and the \n of Germany during \n.\n\nSince the end of the war, most armoured and infantry divisions have had significant numbers of both tank and infantry units within them. The difference has usually been in the mix of battalions assigned. Additionally, in some militaries, armoured divisions are equipped with more advanced or powerful tanks than other divisions.\n\nMountain divisions are infantry divisions given special training and equipment to \n. Some examples of these formations include the \n, the German \n or the French \n.\n\nNazi Germany also organized \"\n divisions\" to operate in more adverse terrain.\n\nItalian Mountain divisions are called \"\n\n\nAn airborne division is an infantry division given special training and equipment for arrival on the battlefield by air (typically via parachute or glider-borne).\n\nThe US, Britain, and Germany experimented during World War II with specialized light infantry divisions capable of being quickly transported by transport aircraft or dropped into an area by parachute or glider. This required both high-quality equipment and training, creating elite units in the process and usually manned by volunteers rather than conscripts.\n\nThe German \n, which was part of the \n and not the \n, was instrumental in the 1941 \n. US and British airborne troops first participated during the 1943 \n.\n The use of airborne divisions during the \n was crucial to its success. Further allied paratroop operations were made during the 1944 \n and the 1945 \n.\n\nWhen not being used for a specific airborne mission, airborne divisions usually functioned as light infantry divisions.\n\nAn \"\n division\" is an airborne division that mainly uses helicopters to transport its troops.\n\n\nThe \n developed the concept of the specialized \"artillery division\" during the \n of the \n in 1942, although plans were in place since the later stages of the \n. An artillery division serves as a specialized division using only artillery howitzers, anti-tank guns, rocket artillery (MRLs and tactical missiles) and mortars (both towed and self-propelled) (and historically siege artillery) and are usually tasked with providing concentrated firepower support to higher combined arms formations. They are mainly combat support formations most performing operations in support of the infantry and armor.\n\nNazi Germany organized Security divisions to operate in captured territory to provide rear-echelon security against \n and maintain order among civilians. Structured like an infantry division, a security division was more likely to contain lower quality troops and was not intended to serve directly at the front. SS units of this type were called \"SS \n divisions\".\n\nThe Soviet Union's People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs (the \n) organized security divisions (see \n). In a few cases, NKVD divisions were employed in front-line combat as rifle divisions.\n\n\nNaming examples\n\n\nDivisions are commonly designated by combining an \n and a type name (e.g.: \"13th Infantry Division\"). Nicknames are often assigned or adopted, although these often are not considered an official part of the unit's \n, with divisions of the \n being one of the exceptions. In some cases, divisional titles lack an ordinal number, often in the case of unique units or units serving as elite or special troops. For clarity in histories and reports, the nation is identified before the number. This also helps in historical studies, but due to the nature of intelligence on the battlefield, division names and assignments are at times obscured. However, the size of the division rarely makes such obfuscation necessary.\n\nIn the years leading up to the end of the cold war and beyond, the type names of various divisions became less important. The majority of US Infantry divisions were now mechanized and had significant numbers of tanks and IFVs, becoming de facto armored divisions. US armored divisions had more tanks but less infantry than these infantry divisions. Moreover, the sole \n was structured the same way as an armored division.\n\nWith the introduction of modular brigade combat teams (BCT) in modern divisions, the nomenclature type is even less important, since a division can now be made of up any combination of light infantry, Stryker and armored BCTs. For example, the US 1st Infantry Division currently \n along with support troops, with no light infantry units at all. By contrast, the current 1st Armored Division \n along with its support troops.\n\nNevertheless, some US division types will retain their mission: The \n and \n airborne divisions have airborne infantry BCTs, while the \n has only light infantry BCTs.\n\nHistorically, the \n has fielded a number of divisions. During World War I, a total of six infantry divisions were raised as part of the all-volunteer \n: \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n. The 1st Division and part of the 2nd saw service during the \n in 1915 before later taking part in the fighting on the \n between 1916 and 1918 along with the 3rd, 4th and 5th.\n The 6th Division existed only briefly in 1917, but was disbanded without seeing combat to make up for manpower shortages in the other divisions.\n Another infantry division, known as the \n, was also formed from Australian and New Zealand troops and saw service at Gallipoli.\n Two divisions of \n were also formed – the \n (which also included some British and French units) and the \n – both of which served in the \n during the war.\n\n\nIn the inter-war years, on paper the Australian Army was organised into seven divisions: five infantry (1st through to 5th) and two cavalry, albeit on a reduced manning scale.\n During World War II, the size of Australia's force was expanded to eventually include 12 infantry divisions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n. Of these, four – the 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th – were raised as part of the all-volunteer \n, while the others formed part of the \n, and were maintained through a mixture of volunteers and \n. In addition to the infantry divisions, three armoured divisions were formed: \n, \n and \n. The Australian divisions were used in various campaigns, ranging from \n, \n,\n\n, to the \n.\n\n\nThe Australian army currently has two divisions. The 1st Division is a skeleton organisation that acts as a deployable force headquarters, while the 2nd is a Reserve formation.\n\n\nThe \n was raised on 20 November 1975 in \n as the first division of the \n. Currently, Bangladesh Army has \n under its command. Each infantry division consists of one artillery brigade, 3 or 4 infantry brigades/regiments. In addition, few divisions have one armored brigade each. The active infantry divisions are:\n\nThe \n currently has five army divisions: the 1st Army Division based in \n and subordinated to the \n, the 2nd Army Division, based in \n and subordinated to the \n and 3rd Army Division, based in \n –  RS, the 5th Army Division based in \n –  PR, the 6th Army Division based in \n –  RS, the latter three being linked to the \n and the 7th Army Division based in \n –  PE subordinated to the \n.\n\nThe other military forces of the Brazilian Army are subordinated directly to the area military commands, not having a commanding division. In this case, the employment of these troops is coordinated by the operations coordinating center of the area military commands.\n\nThe first division-sized formation raised by the \n was the First Contingent of the \n; raised in 1914, it was renamed the Canadian Division in early 1915 when it took to the field, and became the \n when a \n took to the field later that year. A \n and \n saw service in France and \n, and a Fifth Canadian Division was disbanded in the United Kingdom and broken up for reinforcements. The four divisions (collectively under the command of the \n) were disbanded in 1919.\n\nCanada had nominal divisions on paper between the wars, overseeing the Militia (part-time reserve forces), but no active duty divisions. On 1 September 1939, two divisions were raised as part of the Canadian Active Service Force; a Third Division was raised in 1940, followed by a First Canadian (Armoured) Division and Fourth Canadian Division. The First Armoured was renamed the Fifth Canadian (Armoured) Division and the Fourth Division also became an armoured formation. The 1st and 5th Divisions fought in the \n between 1943 and early 1945; the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Divisions served in \n. A Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Division were raised for service in Canada, with one brigade of the Sixth Division going to \n in 1943. By 1945, the latter three divisions were disbanded as the threat to North America diminished. A Third Canadian Division (Canadian Army Occupation Force) was raised in 1945 for \n, organized parallel to the combatant Third Division, and a Sixth Canadian Division (Canadian Army Pacific Force) was undergoing formation and training for the \n when the latter country \n in September 1945. All five combatant divisions, as well as the CAOF and CAPF, were disbanded by the end of 1946.\n\nA First Canadian Division Headquarters (later renamed simply First Division) was authorized once again in April 1946, but remained dormant until formally disbanded in July 1954. Simultaneously, however, another \"Headquarters, First Canadian Infantry Division\" was authorized as part of the Canadian Army Active Force (the Regular forces of the Canadian military), in October 1953. This, the first peacetime division in Canadian history, consisted of a brigade in Germany, one in \n and one at \n. This division was disbanded in April 1958.\n\nThe First Canadian Division was reactivated in 1988 and served until the 1990s when the headquarters of the division was transformed into the \n and placed under the control of the \n. The CFJHQ was transformed back into \n, on 23 June 2010, under command of the \n. The unit is based at \n.  Canada currently has four other divisions and all these are under command of the \n.\n\nThe 1st Canadian Division has approximately 2000 troops under its command, while the \n, \n, \n, and \n have approximately 10,000 troops each.\n\n\nThe \n (PLAGF) is divided into five \n. The regular forces of the ground forces consist of 18 group armies: corps-size combined arms units each with 24,000–50,000 personnel. The group armies contained among them:\n\nAs of 2011, the PLA went from a division-dominated structure to a brigade-dominated one. Until 2017, there were a further three airborne divisions in the \n, but these were reformed into six airborne brigades and a special operations brigade as part of a reform program aimed at reorganizing all PLA divisions into brigades.\n\nThe NRA Division (\n: \n) was a military unit of the \n. The original pattern of the infantry division organization of the early Republic was a \n. It was formed with two infantry brigades of two infantry regiments of three infantry battalions, an artillery regiment of fifty-four guns and eighteen machineguns, a cavalry regiment of twelve squadrons, an engineer battalion of four companies, a transport battalion of four companies, and other minor support units.\n\n\nIn the mid-1930s, the Nationalist government with the help of \n attempted to modernize their army and intended to form sixty \n and a number of reserve divisions. Under the strains and losses of the early campaigns of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese decided in mid-1938 to standardize their Divisions as \n as part of their effort to simplify the command structure and placed them under \n, which became the basic tactical units. The remaining scarce artillery and the other support formations were withdrawn from the Division and were held at Corps or Army level or even higher. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Republic mobilized at least 310 infantry divisions, 23 cavalry divisions, and one mechanized division (the \n).\n\nIn the \n, a division is formed by two or more brigades and is usually commanded by a major general. Today, the Colombian Army has eight active divisions:\n\nIn the \n, a division has four or five brigades and is usually commanded by Major General, however, a Brigadier General can also command a division. Today the \n has 14 divisions (8 mechanized, 1 infantry, 4 armored, 1 Republican Guard). Mechanized divisions have more infantry and fewer tanks than armored divisions while armored divisions have less troops and more tanks than mechanized ones.\n\nOn 1 July 1999, all French divisions were disbanded or converted into brigades. Four \n headquarters (\n) were created in order to oversee \n standard divisions in case of emergency.\n\nThe divisional level (\n) was reintroduced on 1 July 2016. The \n has now two active combined divisions:\n\nEach division consists of 25,000 personnel and is made up of three brigades (one light, one medium, and one heavy). The 1st Division also included the French elements of the \n.\n\nThere are also 11 \"divisional level\" (\n) specialized commands :\n\nThe \n has three divisions:\n\nAn Indian Army division is intermediate between a corps and a brigade. Each division is headed by a \n (GOC) holding the rank of \n. It usually consists of 15,000 combat troops and 8,000 support elements. Currently, the Indian Army has 40 divisions: four RAPIDs (\"Reorganised Army Plains Infantry Divisions\"), 16 infantry, 14 mountain, three armoured, and three artillery. Each division consists of several brigades.\n\nThe \n has 3 infantry divisions (\n: \n) within the \n strategic reserves command which plays a role for strategic defense operations. Aside from the infantry divisions, the Indonesian Army also hosts operational combat units from the territorial commands known as \"\n\", which are equivalent to divisions and are similarly organized as infantry divisions. The infantry divisions from the \n are:\n\nThe Kodam territorial commands are:\n\nThe \n also operates 3 divisions which are:\n\nKostrad infantry divisions are organized into two brigades of infantry (Raider qualified) and a field artillery regiment (the 3rd Division has no artillery regiment, instead it has artillery battalion, the 6th Field Artillery Battalion) as well as combat and service support elements. The regional commands' combat and combat support formations, organized operationally as infantry divisions, have one infantry brigade, an operational second brigade made up of battalions administratively under Military Areas and directly reporting infantry battalions under divisional command, and combat and service support battalions, plus an optional armoured cavalry reconnaissance troop. This organization may be adjusted to the individual needs of the regional commands, \n's infantry division is made up of one infantry brigade, one armored cavalry brigade and one air defense artillery regiment, together with the support elements. The Marine Corps divisions are organized into an infantry brigade, an armored regiment (assault amphibian), an artillery regiment and a combat support regiment, plus an administrative regiment responsible for Marine Corps battalions deployed in support of naval bases and shipyards.\n\nThe \n operates 11 divisions of various sizes that are separated into three categories: regular, territorial and reserve. Regardless of type divisions are organized into brigades.\n\nRegular divisions:\n\nTerritorial divisions:\n\nDivisions in reserve:\n\n divisions are \n units with infantry, armored, and artillery units, combat support units and logistical support units. They are regionally independent and permanent entities. The divisions strength varies from 6,000 to 9,000 personnel. The division commander is a \n.\n\nJGSDF currently has nine active duty divisions (one armored, eight infantry):\n\nAn Army division in the \n is an intermediate between a corps and a brigade. It is the largest striking force in the army. Each division is headed by a General Officer Commanding (GOC) holding the rank of major general. It usually consists of 15,000 combat troops and 8,000 support elements. Currently, the Pakistani Army has 29 divisions: 20 infantry, two armoured, two mechanized, two air defence, two strategic and one artillery. Each division consists of several brigades.\n\nThe \n is currently organized into 11 Infantry Divisions and 1 Mechanized Infantry Division across the Archipelago. A division is usually led by a \n and comprises 3-4 \n of infantry or armor.\n\nIn the \n, a division (\n: \n, дивизия) may have referred to a formation in any of the armed services, and included subunits appropriate to the service such as regiments and battalions, squadrons or naval vessels. Almost all divisions, irrespective of the service branch, had the 3+1+1 structure of major sub-units, which were usually regiments.\n\nThere is also a similarly sounding unit of military organization in Russian military terminology, called \n (дивизион). A \n is used to refer to an artillery or cavalry battalion, a specific part of a ship's crew (\n, 'ship battalion'), or a group of naval vessels (\n).\n\nIn Imperial Russia, infantry formations were designated as (\n: \n), 'infantry'. But on 11 October 1918, all such formations in the new \n were re-designated as (\n: \n), 'rifle'. This was deliberately chosen as a means of breaking with the Imperial past, while also giving these troops a sense of being an elite; in the Imperial Army, the riflemen had been the best of the foot soldiers outside the Guards.\n The new designation also hearkened back to the \n of the 16th to early 18th Centuries, which were also elite troops.\n\nAll Soviet Army infantry, cavalry (until the 1950s) and tank divisions were organized in accordance with a \n (\"state\"; establishment):\n\nArtillery and \n were organized differently.\n\nBefore the Second World War, besides the \n, there were independent tank battalions within rifle divisions. These were meant to reinforce rifle units for the purpose of breaching enemy defences. They had to act in cooperation with the infantry without breaking away from it and were called tanks for immediate infantry support (\n: \n).\n\nAfter 1945, some Red Army rifle divisions were converted to mechanised (infantry) divisions. From 1957, all rifle and mechanised divisions became \"motor rifle divisions\" (MRDs). These divisions usually had approximately 12,000 soldiers. During the Soviet era, 25 different MRD staffing and equipage tables existed to reflect different requirements of divisions stationed in different parts of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact countries and Mongolia. From 1970 to 1983, a motor rifle regiment was added to tank divisions and an independent tank battalion to motor rifle divisions, and major increases in artillery, mortars, and \n, in line with the evolution of Soviet doctrine, which began to recognise the need for a conventional phrase, away from the previously expected purely nuclear operations.\n\n\nA typical tank division had some 10,000 soldiers, less than those of the infantry, with near identical organization. During the Soviet era, 15 different TD staffing and equipage tables existed to reflect different requirements of divisions stationed in different parts of the Soviet Union, the Warsaw Pact countries and Mongolia.\n\nThe Soviet Union organised Machine-Gun Artillery Divisions of artillery, multiple rocket launchers, and static gun positions for use East of the Urals from 1989.\n\nSimilar organizations of units were and still are a part of the \n.\n\nA typical Soviet \"frontal aviation division\" consisted of three air regiments, a transport squadron, and associated maintenance units. The number of aircraft within a regiment varied. Fighter and fighter-bomber regiments were usually equipped with about 40 aircraft (36 of the primary unit type and a few utility and spares), while bomber regiments typically consisted of 32 aircraft. Divisions were typically commanded by colonels or major generals, or colonels or major generals of aviation in the Air Force. Soviet Naval Aviation and the Strategic Missile Forces divisions had either colonels or major generals as commanding officers while the ship divisions were led by captains 1st rank or captains 2nd rank.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russian tank and motor rifle divisions were reduced to near-cadre state, many being designated \"bases for storage of weapons and equipment\" (Russian acronym BKhVT). These bases, or \"cadre\" divisions, were equipped with all the heavy armaments of a full-strength motor-rifle or tank division, while having only skeleton personnel strength, as low as 500 personnel. The officers and men of a cadre division focus primarily on maintaining the equipment in working condition.\n During wartime mobilization, such a division would be reinforced up to full manpower strength; however, in peacetime, a cadre division is unfit for any combat.\n\nFrom 1989 the Soviet and Russian Ground Forces organized a total of eight Machine-Gun Artillery Divisions: the \n; 122nd Guards Machine-Gun Artillery Division; \n; 127th; \n; \n; \n; and 131st Guards Machine-Gun Artillery Divisions.\n A 1997 report said they were generally composed of four brigades with a total of 12 battalions, including a mecanised regiment in each brigade, though later data suggests this was inaccurate.\n Later data indicates that fortified areas were disestablished and converted to Machine-Gun Artillery Regiments which then joined the new MGADs.\n\n\nAfter the \n, most active divisions were disbanded or converted into brigades.\n\nSince 2013, several divisions were reactivated. In 2020, the \n have 10 divisions :\n\nThe \n has :\n\nThe \n have 4 divisions :\n\nThe \n have 12 divisions :\n\nIn addition to the Army divisions, a division is currently on active duty within the ranks of the \n:\n\nAlso, a number of \n and Air Defense Divisions have been reactivated within the \n.\n\nSouth Africa has fielded several infantry and armoured divisions in its military history:\n\nIn the \n, a division is commanded by a \n with a WO1 as the Command Sergeant Major and may consist of three infantry, mechanised and/or armoured brigades and supporting units.\n\nCurrently, the British Army has three active divisions:\n\nThe British Army previously had three other divisions.\n\nAdditionally, most of the infantry regiments of the British Army are organised for administrative purposes into a number of organisations called \"divisions\":\n\nA divisional unit in the United States Army typically consists of 17,000 to 21,000 soldiers, but can grow up to 35,000 to 40,000 with attached support units during operations, and are commanded by a \n. Two divisions usually form a \n and each division consists of three maneuver brigades, an aviation brigade, an engineer brigade, and division artillery (latter two excluded from divisional structure as of 2007), along with a number of smaller specialized units. In 2014, divisional artillery (DIVARTY) organizations began to re-appear, with some \n reorganizing to fill this role.\n\n\nThe United States Army currently has eleven active divisions and one deployable division headquarters (7th Infantry Division):\n\nThe \n has a further eight divisions:\n\nThere are further nine divisions within the \n that are responsible for training and support operations:\n\nThe \n has a further three active divisions and one reserve division. They consist of a headquarters battalion, two or three infantry regiments, an artillery regiment, and a reconnaissance battalion. Additionally, all Marine divisions (MARDIV), except 3rd MARDIV, have an assault amphibian (AA) battalion, a tank battalion, a light armored reconnaissance (LAR) battalion (two in 1st MARDIV), and a combat engineer (CE) battalion (two in 1st MARDIV). (3rd MARDIV has a combat assault battalion including one company each of AA, LAR, and CE. Tank support for 3rd MARDIV can be provided by tanks deployed with the \n or directly from one of the three divisional tank battalions under the \n.)\n\n divisions are major tactical formations led by general officers. There are currently 39 Army and two Marine divisions. Of the 41 Army divisions, six are mechanized infantry divisions (combined arms formations centered around tanks, IFVs, APCs, and SPGs), 16 are infantry divisions (motorized divisions with various levels of mechanization), 12 are \"Homeland Infantry Divisions\" (향토보병사단, infantry divisions kept at a 40–50% manpower level, to be reinforced during national emergencies) and seven \"Reserve Infantry Divisions\" (동원보병사단, infantry divisions kept at 10–20% manpower level, to be reinforced during national emergencies). There are two Marine divisions organized similarly to their American counterparts. Though similarly formed, the 1st ROK Marine Division is specialized to perform amphibious landing operations while the 2nd ROK Marine Division performs more security operations and mans a sector of the DMZ facing the North Korean border.\n\nRepublic of Korea Army divisions are typically smaller than their foreign counterparts. Mechanized infantry divisions are fully formed at around 9,900, infantry divisions are fully formed at about 11,500 men, and other types of divisions are smaller in size during normal operations according to their reserve manpower levels. There are very few articles discussing \n tactical organization, but an active duty force of 29,000 is divided into two divisions, two \n, and its supporting units.\n\nMechanized infantry, infantry, Homeland Infantry, and Marine divisions are led by major generals, while Reserve Infantry Divisions are led by \n. As a general rule no major ROKAF formation contains the number four in its name.\n\n\nThe \n is organized into 6 divisions, four of them infantry, one armored and one being armoured cavalry. All are organized into brigades or regiments, which in turn are organized into infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons, field artillery battalions, air defense artillery battalions and combat engineer battalions. They also contain any divisional service support elements. Usually there are two to five regiments or brigades per division.\n\nThe divisions are:\n"},
{"title": "Shanghai - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\n is one of the four \n of \n. The city is located on the southern \n of the \n, with the \n flowing through it. The population of the city proper is the \n, with around 29.2 million inhabitants in 2023, while the urban area is the \n, with 39.3 million residents. As of 2018, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a \n (\n) of nearly 9.1 trillion \n ($1.33 trillion). Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, \n, research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, \n, and \n. The \n is the \n.\n\nOriginally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five \n forced to open to European trade after the \n which ceded \n to the \n, following the \n in 1841, more than 60 km (37 mi) east of the Portuguese colony of \n that was also controlled by \n following the \n of 1554. The \n and the \n were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the \n, the city was the site of the major \n. After the war, the \n soon resumed between the \n (KMT) and the \n (CCP), with the latter eventually \n and most of the mainland. From the 1950s to the 1970s, trade was mostly limited to other socialist countries in the \n, causing the city's global influence to decline during the \n.\n\nMajor changes of fortune for the city would occur when \n initiated by paramount leader \n during the 1980s resulted in an intense redevelopment and revitalization of the city by the 1990s, especially the \n New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance. It is the home of the \n, one of the \n by market capitalization and the \n, the first \n in mainland China. Shanghai has been classified as an Alpha+ (\n) city by the \n. As of 2022, it is home to 12 companies of the \n and is ranked 4th on the \n. The city is also a global major center for \n and home to numerous \n. The \n, first opened in 1993, is the \n in the world by route length.\n\nShanghai has been described as the \"showpiece\" of the \n. Featuring several architectural styles such as \n and \n, the city is renowned for its \n skyline, museums and historic buildings including the \n, \n, the \n and buildings along \n, which includes \n. Shanghai is also known for its \n, \n, and international flair.\n Shanghai ranks sixth in the \n and it is one of the biggest economic hubs in the world.\n\nThe two \n in the city's name are \n (\n/\n, \"upon\") and \n (\n/\n, \"sea\"), together meaning \"On the Sea.\" The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century \n, when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the \n, the area of modern-day Shanghai was under sea level, so the land appeared to be literally \"on the sea.\"\n\n\nShanghai is officially abbreviated \n (\n/\n) in \n, a contraction of \n (\n/\n, \"\n Ditch\"), a 4th- or \n \n name for the mouth of \n when it was the main conduit into the ocean.\n This character appears on all motor vehicle license plates issued in the municipality today.\n\n\n (\n/\n) or \n (\n/\n, \"Shen City\") was an early name originating from \n, a 3rd-century BC nobleman and prime minister of the \n, whose \n included modern Shanghai.\n Shanghai-based sports teams and newspapers often use Shen in their names, such as \n and \n.\n\n (\n/\n) was another early name for Shanghai. In AD 751 during the mid-Tang dynasty, Huating County was established by \n, the governor of \n, at modern-day Songjiang, the first \n within modern-day Shanghai. The first five-star hotel in the city was named after Huating.\n\n\n (\n/\n, \"Magical City\"), a contemporary nickname for Shanghai, is widely known among the youth.\n The name was first mentioned in \n's 1924 novel \n, which portrayed Shanghai as a dichotomous city where both light and darkness existed.\n\n\nThe city has various nicknames in English, including the \"\n of China\", in reference to its status as a cosmopolitan \n and \n,\n the \"Pearl of the Orient\", and the \"Paris of the East.\"\n This is similar to \n (also known as Saigon), in Vietnam, which has also been nicknamed as \"Paris of the Orient,\" due to Vietnam's historical French status.\n\n\nThe western part of modern-day Shanghai was inhabited 6,000 years ago.\n During the \n (approximately 771 to 476 BC), it belonged to the \n, which was conquered by the \n, which in turn was conquered by the Kingdom of Chu.\n During the \n (475 BC), Shanghai was part of the fief of \n of Chu, one of the \n. He ordered the excavation of the \n. Its former or poetic name, the Chunshen River, gave Shanghai its nickname of \"Shēn.\"\n Fishermen living in the Shanghai area then created a fish tool called the \n, which lent its name to the outlet of Suzhou Creek north of the \n and became a common nickname and \n for the city.\n\n\nDuring the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town (\n) in modern \n was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang \n), it developed into what was historically called a \"giant town of the Southeast,\" with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. \n, a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the \n and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and \n.\n By the end of the Song dynasty, the center of trading had moved downstream of the \n to Shanghai.\n It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike.\n From the \n in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a \n in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day \n.\n\n\nTwo important events helped promote Shanghai's developments in the \n. A \n was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by \n. It measured 10 m (33 ft) high and 5 km (3 mi) in circumference.\n A \n was built in 1602 during the \n reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.\n\n\nDuring the \n, Shanghai became one of the most important seaports in the \n region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the \n reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the \n moved the customs office for \n province (\n;\n see \n) from the prefectural capital of Songjiang to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.\n\n\nIn the 19th century, international attention to Shanghai grew due to \n recognition of its economic and trade potential at the Yangtze. During the \n (1839–1842), British forces occupied the city.\n The war ended in 1842 with the \n, which opened Shanghai as one of the five \n for international trade.\n The \n, the \n, and the \n (signed in 1843, 1844, and 1844, respectively) forced Chinese concession to European and American desires for visitation and trade on Chinese soil. Britain, France, and the \n all established a presence outside the walled city of Shanghai, which remained under the direct administration of the Chinese.\n\n\nThe Chinese-held Old City of Shanghai fell to rebels from the \n in 1853, but control of the city was regained by the Qing government in February 1855.\n In 1854, the \n was created to manage the foreign settlements. Between 1860 and 1862, the \n \n Shanghai and destroyed the city's eastern and southern suburbs, but failed to take the city.\n In 1863, the British settlement to the south of Suzhou Creek (northern \n) and the American settlement to the north (southern \n) joined in order to form the \n. The French opted out of the Shanghai Municipal Council and maintained \n to the south and southwest.\n\n\nThe \n concluded with the 1895 \n, which elevated Japan to become another foreign power in Shanghai. Japan built the first factories in Shanghai, which was soon copied by other foreign powers. All this international activity gave Shanghai the nickname \"the Great \n of China.\"\n In 1914, the Old City walls were dismantled because they blocked the city's expansion. In July 1921, the \n was founded in the French Concession.\n On 30 May 1925, the \n broke out when a worker in a Japanese-owned \n was shot and killed by a Japanese foreman.\n Workers in the city then launched \n against \n, which became nationwide protests that gave rise to \n.\n\n\nThe golden age of Shanghai began with its elevation to municipality after it was separated from \n on 7 July 1927.\n This new Chinese municipality covered an area of 494.69 km\n (191.0 sq mi), including the modern-day districts of \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n, but excluded the foreign concessions territories.\n Headed by a Chinese mayor and municipal council, the new city government's first task—the \n—was to create a new city center in Jiangwan town of Yangpu district, outside the boundaries of the foreign concessions. The plan included a public museum, library, sports stadium, and city hall, which were partially constructed before being interrupted by the Japanese invasion.\n In the 1920s, \n became a new form of entertainment and was popularised in Shanghai.\n\n\nThe city flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of the \n region in the 1930s.\n During the ensuing decades, citizens of many countries and all continents came to Shanghai to live and work; those who stayed for long periods⁠⁠—some for generations⁠—called themselves \"\n.\"\n In the 1920s and 1930s, almost 20,000 \n fled the newly established Soviet Union to reside in Shanghai.\n These \n constituted the second-largest foreign community. By 1932, Shanghai had become the world's fifth largest city and home to 70,000 foreigners.\n In the 1930s, some 30,000 Jewish refugees from Europe arrived in the city.\n\n\nOn \n, Japanese forces invaded Shanghai while the Chinese resisted. More than 10,000 shops and hundreds of factories and public buildings\n were destroyed, leaving Zhabei district ruined. About 18,000 civilians were either killed, injured, or declared missing.\n A ceasefire was brokered on 5 May.\n In 1937, the \n resulted in the occupation of the Chinese-administered parts of Shanghai outside of the International Settlement and the French Concession. People who stayed in the occupied city suffered on a daily basis, experiencing hunger, oppression, or death.\n The foreign concessions were ultimately occupied by the Japanese on 8 December 1941 and remained occupied until Japan's surrender in 1945; multiple \n were committed during that time.\n\n\nA side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the \n. Japanese consul to \n, \n, \n issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi's \n. They traveled from \n, Lithuania across Russia by railroad to the \n from where they traveled by ship to \n. Their stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District, and after the Japanese \n, even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the \n, including its students and faculty. On 3 September 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years.\n\n\nOn 27 May 1949, the \n took control of Shanghai through the \n. Under the new People's Republic of China (PRC), Shanghai was one of only three municipalities not merged into neighboring provinces (the others being \n and \n).\n Most foreign firms moved their offices from Shanghai to \n, as part of a foreign \n due to the PRC's victory.\n\n\nAfter the war, Shanghai's economy was restored—from 1949 to 1952, the city's agricultural and industrial output increased by 51.5% and 94.2%, respectively.\n There were 20 urban districts and 10 suburbs at the time.\n On 17 January 1958, \n, Baoshan, and \n in Jiangsu became part of Shanghai Municipality, which expanded to 863 km\n (333.2 sq mi). The following December, the land area of Shanghai was further expanded to 5,910 km\n (2,281.9 sq mi) after more surrounding suburban areas in Jiangsu were added: \n, \n, Qingpu, \n, \n, and \n.\n In 1964, the city's administrative divisions were rearranged to 10 urban districts and 10 counties.\n\n\nAs the industrial center of China with the most skilled industrial workers, Shanghai became a center for radical \n during the 1950s and 1960s. The radical leftist \n and her three allies, together the \n, were based in the city.\n During the \n (1966–1976), Shanghai's society was severely damaged. The majority of the workers in the Shanghai branch of the \n were \n and they formed a group called the Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters within the branch.\n The Anti-Economy Liaison Headquarters dismantled economic organizations in Shanghai, investigated bank withdrawals, and disrupted regular bank service in the city.\nThe Shanghai People's Commune was established in the city during the \n of 1967. Despite the disruptions of the Cultural Revolutions, Shanghai maintained economic production with a positive annual growth rate.\n \n\nDuring the \n campaign to develop basic industry and heavy industry in China's hinterlands in case of invasion by the Soviet Union or the United States, 354,900 Shanghainese were sent to work on Third Front projects.\n The centerpiece of Shanghai's Small Third Front project was the \"rear base\" in Anhui rear base which served as \"a multi-function manufacturing base for anti-aircraft and anti-tank weaponry.\n\n\nSince 1949, Shanghai has been a comparatively heavy contributor of tax revenue to the central government; in 1983, the city's contribution in tax revenue was greater than investment received in the past 33 years combined.\n Its importance to the fiscal well-being of the central government also denied it from \n begun in 1978. \n\nIn 1990, \n permitted Shanghai to initiate economic reforms, which reintroduced foreign capital to the city and developed the Pudong district, resulting in the birth of \n.\n That year, the China's central government designated Shanghai as the \"Dragon Head\" of \n.\n As of 2020, Shanghai is classified as an Alpha+ city by the \n, making it one of the world's Top 10 major cities.\n\n\nIn early 2022, Shanghai experienced a large outbreak of \n cases. After localized lockdowns failed to stem the rise in cases, the \n the entire city on 5 April. This resulted in widespread food shortages across the city emerged as food-supply chains were severely disrupted by the government's lockdown measures, which was not lifted until 1 June.\n\n\nShanghai is located on the Yangtze \n of China's east coast, with the Yangtze River to the north and \n to the south, with the \n to the east. The land is formed by the Yangtze's natural \n and modern \n projects. As such, it has \n, and skyscrapers have to be built with deep concrete piles to avoid sinking into the soft ground.\n The provincial-level \n administers both the estuary and many of its \n. It borders the provinces of \n to the south and \n to the west and north.\n The municipality's northernmost point is on \n, which is the second-largest \n after its expansion during the 20th century.\n It does not administratively include an \n of Jiangsu on northern Chongming or the two islands forming Shanghai's \n, which are parts of Zhejiang's \n.\n\nShanghai is located on an \n. As such, the vast majority of its 6,340.5 km\n (2,448.1 sq mi) land area is flat, with an average elevation of 4 m (13 ft).\n Tidal flat ecosystems exist around the estuary, however, they have long been reclaimed for agricultural purposes.\n The city's few hills, such as \n, lie to the southwest, and its highest point is the peak of \n (103 m or 338 ft) in Hangzhou Bay.\n Shanghai has many rivers, canals, streams, and lakes, and it is known for its rich water resources as part of the \n \n.\n\n\nDowntown Shanghai is bisected by the Huangpu River, a man-made \n of the Yangtze created by order of Lord Chunshen during the Warring States period.\n The historic center of the city was located on the west bank of the Huangpu (\n), near the mouth of Suzhou Creek, connecting it with Lake Tai and the \n. The central financial district, Lujiazui, has been established on the east bank of the Huangpu (Pudong). Along Shanghai's eastern shore, the destruction of local \n due to the construction of \n has been partially offset by the protection and expansion of a nearby shoal, \n, as a nature preserve.\n\n\nShanghai has a \n (\n: \n), with an average annual temperature of 17.5 °C (63.5 °F) for downtown area and 16.2–17.2 °C (61.2–63.0 °F) for suburbs.\n The city experiences four distinct seasons. Winters are temperate to cold and damp—northwesterly winds from \n can cause nighttime temperatures to drop below freezing. Each year, there are an average of 4.7 days with snowfall and 1.6 days with snow cover.\n Summers are hot and humid, and occasional downpours or freak \n can be expected. On average, 14.5 days exceed 35 °C (95 °F) annually. In summer and the beginning of autumn, the city is susceptible to \n.\n\n\nThe most pleasant seasons are generally spring, although changeable and often rainy, and autumn, which is usually sunny and dry. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 31% in June to 50% in August, the city receives 1,754 hours of bright sunshine annually.（All the mean values mentioned in this paragraph are data observed in Baoshan District） Extremes since 1951 have ranged from −10.1 °C (14 °F) on 31 January 1977 (unofficial record of −12.1 °C (10 °F) was set on 19 January 1893) to 40.9 °C (106 °F) on 13 July 2022 at a \n in \n.\n\n, located by the bank of the Huangpu River, is home to a row of early 20th-century architecture, ranging in style from the \n \n to the \n Sassoon House (now part of the \n). Many areas in the former foreign concessions are also well-preserved, the most notable being the French Concession.\n Shanghai is also home to many architecturally distinctive and even eccentric buildings, including the \n, the \n, the \n, and the \n. Despite rampant redevelopment, the Old City still retains some traditional architecture and designs, such as the \n, an elaborate \n style garden.\n\n\nAs a result of its construction boom during the 1920s and 1930s, Shanghai has among the most Art Deco buildings in the world.\n One of the most famous architects working in Shanghai was \n, a \n who lived in the city between 1918 and 1947.\n His most notable Art Deco buildings include the \n, the \n, and the \n.\n Other prominent architects who contributed to the Art Deco style are \n, who together designed the Peace Hotel, the \n, and the \n;\n and Austrian architect \n, who designed the \n. The Bund has been revitalized several times. The first was in 1986, with a new \n by the Dutch architect Paulus Snoeren.\n The second was before the \n, which includes restoration of the century-old \n and reconfiguration of traffic flow.\n\n\nOne distinctive cultural element is the \n (\n, \"stone storage door\") residence, typically two- or three-story gray brick houses with the front yard protected by a heavy wooden door in a stylistic stone arch.\n Each residence is connected and arranged in straight alleys, known as \n (\n). The house is similar to western-style \n or \n, but distinguished by the tall, heavy brick wall and archway in front of each house.\n\n\nThe shikumen is a cultural blend of elements found in Western architecture with traditional Jiangnan Chinese architecture and social behavior.\n Like almost all traditional Chinese dwellings, it has a \n, which reduces outside noise. Vegetation can be grown in the courtyard, and it can also allow for sunlight and ventilation to the rooms.\n\n\nSome of Shanghai's buildings feature \n neoclassical architecture or \n, though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the \n in 1949 and the \n in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day \n.\n\n\nShanghai—Lujiazui in particular—has \n, making it the fifth \n.\n Among the most prominent examples are the 421 m (1,381 ft) high \n, the 492 m (1,614 ft) high \n, and the 632 m (2,073 ft) high \n, which is the tallest building in China and the \n.\n Completed in 2015, the tower takes the form of nine twisted sections stacked atop each other, totaling 128 floors.\n It is featured in its \n design, which eliminates the need for either layer to be opaqued for reflectivity as the double-layer structure has already reduced the heat absorption.\n The futuristic-looking Oriental Pearl Tower, at 468 m (1,535 ft), is located nearby at the northern tip of Lujiazui.\n Skyscrapers outside of Lujiazui include the \n in Hongkou, the \n in Huangpu, and the \n in \n.\n\nLike all \n, Shanghai has a parallel party-government system,\n in which the \n, officially termed the \n Shanghai Municipal Committee Secretary, outranks the \n.\n The \n acts as the top policy-formulation body, and is typically composed of 12 members (including the secretary), and has control over the \n.\n\n\nPolitical power in Shanghai has frequently been a stepping stone to higher positions in the central government. Since \n became the \n in June 1989, all former Shanghai party secretaries but one were elevated to the \n, the \n highest decision-making body in China,\n including Jiang himself (Party General Secretary),\n \n (Premier),\n \n (NPC Chairman),\n \n (Vice Premier),\n \n (current General Secretary),\n \n (CPPCC Chairman),\n \n (Vice Premier and Vice President),\n and \n (Premier). \n, a former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, also rose to the Politburo Standing Committee and became the Vice President and an influential power broker.\n \n, another former deputy party secretary of Shanghai, has become the Politburo Standing Committee and Secretary of \n member in 2022. The only exception is \n, who was fired in 2006 and later convicted of \n.\n\n\nOfficials with ties to the Shanghai administration collectively form a powerful faction in the central government known as the \n, which has often been viewed to compete against the rival \n over personnel appointments and policy decisions.\n However, Xi Jinping, successor to \n as General Secretary and \n, was largely an independent leader and took \n on both factions.\n\n\nShanghai is one of the four \n under the direct administration of the \n,\n and is divided into 16 \n \n.\n\nAlthough every district has its own urban core, the city hall and major administrative units are located in Huangpu District, which also serves as a commercial area, including the famous \n. Other major commercial areas include \n and \n in Huangpu District, and Xujiahui\n in \n. Many \n are located in residential areas in Yangpu District and \n.\n\nSeven of the districts govern Puxi (\n \"The West Bank,\" or \"West of the River Pu\"), the older part of urban Shanghai on the west bank of the Huangpu River. These seven districts are collectively referred to as Shanghai Proper (\n) or the core city (\n), which comprise Huangpu, Xuhui, \n, Jing'an, Putuo, Hongkou, and Yangpu.\n\nPudong (\n \"The East Bank,\" or \"East of the River Pu\"), the newer part of urban and suburban Shanghai on the east bank of the Huangpu River, is governed by \n (\n).\n\n\nSeven of the districts govern suburbs, satellite towns, and rural areas farther away from the urban core: Baoshan,\n \n,\n Jiading,\n Jinshan,\n Songjiang,\n Qingpu,\n and Fengxian.\n\n\nChongming District comprises the islands of Changxing and Hengsha and most—but not all\n—of Chongming Island.\n\nThe former district of Nanhui was absorbed into Pudong District in 2009. In 2011, Luwan District merged with Huangpu District. As of 2015\n, these county-level divisions are further divided into the following 210 \n: 109 \n, 2 \n, and 99 \n.

Several industrial zones—including Shanghai Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone, Jinqiao Export Economic Processing Zone, Minhang Economic and Technological Development Zone, and Shanghai Caohejing High-Tech Development Zone—are backbones of Shanghai's \n. Shanghai is home to China's largest steelmaker \n, China's largest \n base \n, and one of China's oldest shipbuilders, the \n.\n Auto manufacturing is another important industry. The Shanghai-based \n is one of the three largest automotive corporations in China, and has strategic partnerships with \n and \n.\n\n\nTourism is a major industry of Shanghai.

Currently, two port chain centers have been approved for construction in Waigaoqiao and Yangshan.\n Several preferential policies have been implemented to attract foreign investment in various industries to the zone. Because the zone is not technically considered Chinese territory for tax purposes, commodities entering the zone are exempt from duty and customs clearance.\n\n\nAs of 2022\n, Shanghai had a total population of 24,758,900, including 14,693,630 (59.3%) \n holders (registered locally).\n As of 2022\n, 89.3% of Shanghai's population live in urban areas, and 10.7% live in rural areas.\n Based on the population of its total administrative area, Shanghai is the second largest of the four municipalities of China, behind \n, but is generally considered the largest Chinese city because the urban population of Chongqing is much smaller.\n According to the \n, Shanghai's \n has an estimated population of 34 million.\n\n\nAccording to the Shanghai Municipal Statistics Bureau, about 157,900 residents in Shanghai are foreigners, including 28,900 Japanese, 21,900 Americans and 20,800 Koreans.\n The actual number of foreign citizens in the city is probably much higher.\n Shanghai is also a domestic immigration city—40.3% (9.8 million) of the city's residents are from other regions of China.\n\n\nShanghai has a \n of 83.18 years for the city's registered population,\n the highest life expectancy of \n. This has also caused the city to \n—in 2021, 17.4% (4.3 million) of the city's registered population was aged 65 or above.\n In 2017, the Chinese government implemented population controls for Shanghai, resulting in a population decline of 10,000 people by the end of the year.\n\n\nDue to its cosmopolitan history, Shanghai has a blend of religious heritage; religious buildings and institutions are scattered around the city.

The Protestant \n in \n was built in 1925 and features a \n tower.\n\nAlthough currently making up a fraction of the religious population in Shanghai, Jewish people have played an influential role in the city's history. After the \n ended the \n in 1842, the city was opened up to western populations and merchants traveled to Shanghai for its rich business potential, including many prominent Jewish families. The \n amassed great wealth in the opium and textile trades, cementing their status by funding many of the buildings that have become iconic in Shanghai's skyline, such as the Cathay Hotel in 1929.\n The \n were another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family that used their business success to define Shanghai in the 20th century. The head of the family, Silas Hardoon, one of the richest people in the world during the 1800s, financed \n, which then housed departmental stores in the International Settlement, that is now one of the busiest shopping centers in the world.\n\n\nDuring \n, thousands of Jews emigrated to Shanghai in an effort to flee \n. They lived in a designated area called the Shanghai Ghetto and formed a community centered on the Ohel Moishe Synagogue, which is now the \n.\n In 1939, Horace \n, the head of the powerful philanthropic Sephardic Jewish family in Shanghai, founded the Shanghai Jewish Youth Association to support Jewish refugees through English education so they would be prepared to emigrate from Shanghai when the time came.\n\n\n came into Shanghai during the Yuan dynasty. The city's first mosque, \n, was built during the Zhizheng (\n) era under \n (reigned 1333 – 1368). Shanghai's \n population increased in the 19th and early 20th centuries (when the city was a treaty port), during which time many mosques—including the \n, the \n, and the \n—were built. The Shanghai Islamic Association is located in the Xiaotaoyuan Mosque in Huangpu.\n\n\nShanghai has several folk religious temples, including the City God Temple at the heart of the Old City, the \n dedicated to the Three Kingdoms general \n, the \n, and a major Taoist center \n where the Shanghai Taoist Association locates.\n\n\nThe \n language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, part of the \n subgroup of the \n language family. This is different from the national language, \n, which is mutually unintelligible with Wu Chinese.\n Modern Shanghainese derives from the indigenous Wu spoken in the former Songjiang prefecture but has been influenced by other dialects of Taihu Wu, most notably \n, and \n\n\nPrior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was not as prominent as those spoken around \n and later \n,\n and was known as \"the local tongue\" (\n), a name which is now used in suburbs only.\n In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese (\n or simply \n) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the \n of the \n region. At the time, most of the immigration into the city came from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the local dialects of which had the greatest influence on Shanghainese. After 1949, Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government.\n Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua (Mandarin) as a \n. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.\n\n\nShanghai is an international center of research and development and as of 2022, it was ranked \n and second in the whole Asia & Oceania region (after \n) by scientific research outputs, as tracked by the \n.\n It is also a major center of \n.

It was founded in 1986. The Shanghai International Film Festival was founded in 1993 and is one of the nine major international film festivals in the A category. The highest award is the \"Golden Goblet Award\"\n\n\nSince 2001, Shanghai has held its own \n called \n twice every year in April and October. The main venue is in \n, and the opening and closing ceremonies are held in the Shanghai Fashion Center. The April session is also part of the one-month \n.\n Shanghai Fashion Week is considered to be an event of national significance featuring both international and Chinese designers.

Fuxing Park, located in the former French Concession, features formal French-style gardens and is surrounded by high-end bars and cafes.\n\n\n, in western central Shanghai, is famous for its monument of \n, the tallest statue dedicated to the composer in the world.\n Built in 1914 as Jessfield Park, it once contained the campus of \n, Shanghai's first international college; today, the park features \n and \n gardens and a 150-year-old \n,\n and it also serves as an interchange hub in the metro system.\n\n\nOne of Shanghai's newer parks is the \n, which was built in 1999, on the former grounds of the Great Chinese Rubber Works Factory and the EMI Recording Studio (now La Villa Rouge restaurant). The park has an artificial lake with a sky bridge running across the park.\n \n is located 12 km (7 mi) southwest of the city center and was established in 1978.

The \n (JMSDF) was formed between 1952 and 1954 after the dissolution of the IJN.\n\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy was the third largest navy in the world by 1920, behind the \n and the \n (USN).\n It was supported by the \n for aircraft and airstrike operation from the fleet. It was the primary opponent of the \n in the \n.\n\nThe origins of the Imperial Japanese Navy go back to early interactions with nations on the \n, beginning in the early \n and reaching a peak of activity during the 16th and 17th centuries at a time of \n with \n \n during the \n. After two centuries of stagnation during the country's ensuing \n under the \n of the \n, Japan's navy was comparatively backward when the country was forced open to trade by \n in 1854. This eventually led to the \n. Accompanying the re-ascendance of the \n came a period of frantic \n and \n. The navy had several successes, sometimes against much more powerful enemies such as in the \n and the \n, before being largely destroyed in World War II.\n\nJapan has a long history of naval interaction with the Asian continent, involving transportation of troops between \n and Japan, starting at least with the beginning of the \n in the 3rd century.\n\n\nFollowing the attempts at \n by \n in 1274 and 1281, Japanese \n became very active in \n the coast of \n.\n In response to threats of Chinese invasion of Japan, in 1405 the shogun \n capitulated to Chinese demands and sent twenty captured Japanese pirates to China, where they were boiled in a cauldron in \n.\n\n\nJapan undertook major naval building efforts in the 16th century, during the \n when feudal rulers vying for supremacy built vast coastal navies of several hundred ships. Around that time Japan may have developed one of the first \n warships when \n, a \n, had six iron-covered \n made in 1576.\n In 1588 \n issued a ban on Wakō piracy; the pirates then became vassals of Hideyoshi, and comprised the naval force used in the \n.\n\n\nJapan built her first large ocean-going warships in the beginning of the 17th century, following contacts with the Western nations during the \n. In 1613, the \n of \n, in agreement with the \n \n, built \n, a 500-ton \n-type ship that transported the Japanese embassy of \n to the Americas, which then continued to Europe.\n From 1604 the Bakufu also commissioned about 350 \n, usually armed and incorporating some Western technologies, mainly for \n trade.\n\n\nFor more than 200 years, beginning in the 1640s, the Japanese policy of seclusion (\"\n\") forbade contacts with the outside world and prohibited the construction of ocean-going ships on pain of death.\n Contacts were maintained, however, with the Dutch through the port of \n, the Chinese also through Nagasaki and the Ryukyus and Korea through intermediaries with Tsushima. The study of Western sciences, called \"\n\" through the Dutch enclave of \n in Nagasaki led to the transfer of knowledge related to the Western technological and \n which allowed Japan to remain aware of naval sciences, such as \n, \n and mechanical sciences. Seclusion, however, led to the loss of any naval and maritime traditions the nation possessed.\n\n\nApart from Dutch trade ships, no other Western vessels were allowed to enter Japanese ports. A notable exception was during the \n when neutral ships flew the Dutch flag. Frictions with the foreign ships, however, started from the beginning of the 19th century. The \n involving \n in 1808, and other subsequent incidents in the following decades, led the shogunate to enact an \n. Western ships, which were increasing their presence around Japan due to whaling and the trade with China, began to challenge the seclusion policy.\n\n\nThe \n in 1837 and news of China's defeat during the \n led the shogunate to repeal the law to execute foreigners, and instead to adopt the Order for the Provision of Firewood and Water. The shogunate also began to strengthen the nation's coastal defenses. Many Japanese realized that traditional ways would not be sufficient to repel further intrusions, and western knowledge was utilized through the Dutch at Dejima to reinforce Japan's capability to repel the foreigners; field guns, mortars, and firearms were obtained, and coastal defenses reinforced. \n ended in failure, in part to Japanese resistance, until the early 1850s.\n\n\nDuring 1853 and 1854, American warships under the command of \n, entered \n and made demonstrations of force requesting trade negotiations. After two hundred years of seclusion, the 1854 \n led to the \n to international trade and interaction. This was soon followed by the 1858 \n and \n.\n\n\nAs soon as Japan opened up to foreign influences, the Tokugawa shogunate recognized the vulnerability of the country from the sea and initiated an active policy of assimilation and adoption of Western naval technologies.\n In 1855, with Dutch assistance, the shogunate acquired its first steam warship, \n, and began using it for training, establishing a \n at Nagasaki.\n\n\n such as the future Admiral \n (1836–1908) was sent by the shogunate to study in the Netherlands for several years.\n In 1859 the Naval Training Center relocated to \n in \n. In 1857 the shogunate acquired its first screw-driven steam warship \n and used it as an escort for the \n. In 1865 the French naval engineer \n was hired to build Japan's first modern naval arsenals, at \n and \n.\n\n\nThe shogunate also allowed and then ordered various \n to purchase warships and to develop naval fleets,\n \n, especially, had petitioned the shogunate to build modern naval vessels.\n A naval center had been set up by the Satsuma domain in Kagoshima, students were sent abroad for training and a number of ships were acquired.\n The domains of \n, \n, \n and \n joined Satsuma in acquiring ships.\n These naval elements proved insufficient during the \n's \n in 1863 and the \n in 1863–64.\n\n\nBy the mid-1860s the shogunate had a fleet of eight warships and thirty-six auxiliaries.\n Satsuma (which had the largest domain fleet) had nine steamships,\n Choshu had five ships plus numerous auxiliary craft, Kaga had ten ships and Chikuzen eight.\n Numerous smaller domains also had acquired a number of ships. However, these fleets resembled maritime organizations rather than actual navies with ships functioning as transports as well as combat vessels;\n they were also manned by personnel who lacked experienced seamanship except for coastal sailing and who had virtually no combat training.\n\n\nThe \n in 1868 led to the overthrow of the shogunate. From 1868, the newly formed \n continued with reforms to centralize and modernize Japan.\n\n\nAlthough the Meiji reformers had overthrown the Tokugawa shogunate, tensions between the former ruler and the restoration leaders led to the \n (January 1868 to June 1869). The early part of the conflict largely involved land battles, with naval forces playing a minimal role transporting troops from western to eastern Japan.\n Only the \n (28 January 1868) was significant; this also proved one of the few Tokugawa successes in the war. \n eventually surrendered after the \n in July 1868, and as a result most of Japan accepted the emperor's rule, however resistance continued \n.\n\n\nOn 26 March 1868 the first naval review in Japan took place in \n, with six ships from the private domain navies of \n, Chōshū, \n, \n, \n and \n participating. The total tonnage of these ships was 2,252 tons, which was far smaller than the tonnage of the single foreign vessel (from the French Navy) that also participated. The following year, in July 1869, the Imperial Japanese Navy was formally established, two months after the last combat of the Boshin War.\n\n\nEnomoto Takeaki, the admiral of the \ns navy, refused to surrender all his ships, remitting just four vessels, and escaped to northern \n with the remnants of the \ns navy: eight steam warships and 2,000 men. Following the defeat of pro-shogunate resistance on Honshū, Admiral Enomoto Takeaki fled to \n, where he established the breakaway \n (27 January 1869). The new Meiji government dispatched a military force to defeat the rebels, culminating with the \n in May 1869.\n The Imperial side took delivery (February 1869) of the French-built ironclad \n (originally ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate) and used it decisively towards the end of the conflict.\n\n\nIn February 1868 the Imperial government had placed all captured shogunate naval vessels under the Navy Army affairs section.\n In the following months, military forces of the government came under the control of several organizations which were established and then disbanded until the establishment of the \n and of the \n in 1872. For the first two years (1868–1870) of the Meiji state no national, centrally controlled navy existed,\n – the Meiji government only administered those Tokugawa vessels captured in the early phase of the Boshin War of 1868–1869.\n All other naval vessels remained under the control of the various domains which had been acquired during the \n period. The naval forces mirrored the political environment of Japan at the time: the domains retained their political as well as military independence from the Imperial government. \n a former Tokugawa navy leader, was brought into the government as Vice Minister of the Navy in 1872, and became the first \n from 1873 until 1878 because of his naval experience and his ability to control Tokugawa personnel who retained positions in the government naval forces. Upon assuming office Katsu Kaishu recommended the rapid centralization of all naval forces – government and domain – under one agency.\n The nascent Meiji government in its first years did not have the necessary political and military force to implement such a policy and so, like much of the government, the naval forces retained a decentralized structure in most of 1869 through 1870.\n\n\nThe incident involving Enomoto Takeaki's refusal to surrender and his escape to Hokkaidō with a large part of the former Tokugawa Navy's best warships embarrassed the Meiji government politically. The imperial side had to rely on considerable naval assistance from the most powerful domains as the government did not have enough naval power to put down the rebellion on its own.\n Although the rebel forces in Hokkaidō surrendered, the government's response to the rebellion demonstrated the need for a strong centralized naval force.\n Even before the rebellion the restoration leaders had realized the need for greater political, economic and military centralization and by August 1869 most of the domains had returned their lands and population registers to the government.\n In 1871 the domains were abolished altogether and as with the political context the centralization of the navy began with the domains donating their forces to the central government.\n As a result, in 1871 Japan could finally boast a centrally controlled navy, this was also the institutional beginning of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\n\nIn February 1872, the Ministry of War was replaced by a separate Army Ministry and Navy Ministry. In October 1873, Katsu Kaishū became Navy Minister.\n\n\nAfter the consolidation of the government the new Meiji state set about to build up national strength. The Meiji government honored the treaties with the Western powers signed during the Bakumatsu period with the ultimate goal of revising them, leading to a subsided threat from the sea. This however led to conflict with those disgruntled samurai who wanted to expel the westerners and with groups which opposed  the Meiji reforms. Internal dissent – including peasant uprisings – become a greater concern for the government, which curtailed plans for naval expansion as a result. In the immediate period from 1868 many members of the Meiji coalition advocated giving preference to maritime forces over the army and saw naval strength as paramount.\n In 1870 the new government drafted an ambitious plan to develop a navy with 200 ships organized into ten fleets. The plan was abandoned within a year due to lack of resources.\n Financial considerations were a major factor restricting the growth of the navy during the 1870s.\n Japan at the time was not a wealthy state. Soon, however, domestic rebellions, the \n (1874) and especially the \n (1877), forced the government to focus on land warfare, and the army gained prominence.\n\n\nNaval policy, as expressed by the slogan \n (literally: \"Static Defense\"), focused on coastal defenses,\n on a standing army (established with the assistance of the second \n), and a coastal navy that could act in a supportive role to drive an invading enemy from the coast. The resulting military organization followed the \n (Army first, Navy second) principle.\n This meant a defense designed to repel an enemy from Japanese territory, and the chief responsibility for that mission rested upon Japan's army; consequently, the army gained the bulk of the military expenditures.\n During the 1870s and 1880s, the Imperial Japanese Navy remained an essentially coastal-defense force, although the Meiji government continued to modernize it. \n (soon renamed \n) commissioned by \n was launched at \n, \n on 27 March 1869.\n\n\nIn 1870 an Imperial decree determined that Britain's Royal Navy should serve as the model for development, instead of the Netherlands navy.\n In 1873 a thirty-four-man British naval mission, headed by Lt. Comdr. Archibald Douglas, arrived in Japan. Douglas directed instruction at the Naval Academy at Tsukiji for several years, the mission remained in Japan until 1879, substantially advancing the development of the navy and firmly establishing British traditions within the Japanese navy from matters of seamanship to the style of its uniforms and the attitudes of its officers.\n\n\nFrom September 1870, the English Lieutenant Horse, a former gunnery instructor for the \n during the Bakumatsu period, was put in charge of gunnery practice on board the \n. In 1871, the ministry resolved to send 16 trainees abroad for training in naval sciences (14 to Great Britain, two to the United States), among which was Heihachirō Tōgō. Later, Commander \n was hired in 1879 to train naval cadets.\n\n\nShips such as the \n, \n and \n were built in British shipyards, and they were the first warships built abroad specifically for the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n Private construction companies such as \n and \n also emerged around this time.\n\n\nDuring 1873, a plan to invade the \n, the \n proposal made by \n, was narrowly abandoned by decision of the central government in Tokyo.\n In 1874, the \n was the first foray abroad of the new Imperial Japanese Navy and \n after the \n, however the navy served largely as a transport force.\n\n\nVarious interventions in the Korean Peninsula continued in 1875–1876, starting with the \n provoked by the Japanese gunboat \n, leading to the dispatch of a large force of the Imperial Japanese Navy. As a result, the \n was signed, marking the official opening of Korea to foreign trade, and Japan's first example of Western-style interventionism and adoption of \"unequal treaties\" tactics.\n\n\nIn 1878, the Japanese cruiser \n sailed to Europe with an entirely Japanese crew.\n\n\nAfter the \n in July 1882, \n submitted a document to the \n titled \"Opinions Regarding Naval Expansion\" asserting that a strong navy was essential to maintaining the security of Japan.\n In furthering his argument, Iwakura suggested that domestic rebellions were no longer Japan's primary military concern and that naval affairs should take precedence over army concerns; a strong navy was more important than a sizable army to preserve the Japanese state.\n Furthermore, he justified that a large, modern navy, would have the added potential benefit of instilling Japan with greater international prestige\n and recognition, as navies were internationally recognized hallmarks of power and status.\n Iwakura also suggested that the Meiji government could support naval growth by increasing taxes on tobacco, sake, and soy.\n\n\nAfter lengthy discussions, Iwakura eventually convinced the ruling coalition to support Japan's first multi-year naval expansion plan in history.\n In May 1883, the government approved a plan that, when completed, would add 32 warships over eight years at a cost of just over ¥26 million.\n This development was very significant for the navy, as the amount allocated virtually equaled the navy's entire budget between 1873 and 1882.\n The 1882 naval expansion plan succeeded in a large part because of Satsuma power, influence, and patronage.\n Between 19 August and 23 November 1882, Satsuma forces with Iwakura's leadership, worked tirelessly to secure support for the Navy's expansion plan.\n After uniting the other Satsuma members of the Dajokan, Iwakura approached the emperor the \n arguing persuasively just as he did with the Dajokan, that naval expansion was critical to Japan's security and that the standing army of forty thousand men was more than sufficient for domestic purposes.\n While the government should direct the lion's share of future military appropriations toward naval matters, a powerful navy would legitimize an increase in tax revenue.\n On November 24, the emperor assembled select ministers of the \n together with military officers, and announced the need for increased tax revenues to provide adequate funding for military expansion, this was followed by an imperial re-script. The following month, in December, an annual ¥7.5-million tax increase on sake, soy, and tobacco was fully approved, in the hopes that it would provide ¥3.5 million annually for warship construction and ¥2.5 million for warship maintenance.\n In February 1883, the government directed further revenues from other ministries to support an increase in the navy's warship construction and purchasing budget. By March 1883, the navy secured the ¥6.5 million required annually to support an eight-year expansion plan, this was the largest that the Imperial Japanese Navy had secured in its young existence.\n\n\nHowever, naval expansion remained a highly contentious issue for both the government and the navy throughout much of the 1880s. Overseas advances in naval technology increased the costs of purchasing large components of a modern fleet, so that by 1885 cost overruns had jeopardized the entire 1883 plan. Furthermore, increased costs coupled with decreased domestic tax revenues, heightened concern and political tension in Japan regarding funding naval expansion.\n\nIn 1883, two large warships were ordered from British shipyards.\n\n\nThe \n and \n were 3,650 ton ships. They were capable of speeds up to 18 kn (33 km/h; 21 mph) and were armed with 54 to 76 mm (2 to 3 in) deck armor and two 260 mm (10 in) \n guns. The naval architect Sasō Sachū designed these on the line of the Elswick class of \n but with superior specifications.\n An \n was taking place with \n however, who equipped herself with two 7,335 ton German-built \n (\n and \n). Unable to confront the Chinese fleet with only two modern cruisers, Japan resorted to French assistance to build a large, modern fleet which could prevail in the upcoming conflict.\n\n\nDuring the 1880s, France took the lead in influence, due to its \"\n\" (\"young school\") doctrine, favoring small, fast warships, especially \n and \n, against bigger units.\n The choice of France may also have been influenced by the Minister of the Navy, who happened to be Enomoto Takeaki at that time (Navy Minister 1880–1885), a former ally of the French during the Boshin War. Also, Japan was uneasy with being dependent on Great Britain, at a time when Great Britain was very close to China.\n\n\nThe \n government issued its First Naval Expansion bill in 1882, requiring the construction of 48 warships, of which 22 were to be torpedo boats.\n The naval successes of the \n against China in the \n of 1883–85 seemed to validate the potential of torpedo boats, an approach which was also attractive to the limited resources of Japan.\n In 1885, the new Navy slogan became \n (Jp:海国日本, \"Maritime Japan\").\n\n\nIn 1885, the leading French Navy engineer \n was hired for four years to reinforce the Japanese Navy and to direct the construction of the arsenals of \n and \n.\n He developed the \n class of cruisers; three units featuring a single powerful main gun, the 320 mm (13 in) \n.\n Altogether, Bertin supervised the building of more than 20 units. They helped establish the first true modern naval force of Japan. It allowed Japan to achieve mastery in the building of large units, since some of the ships were imported, and some others were built domestically at the arsenal of Yokosuka:\n\nThis period also allowed Japan \"to embrace the revolutionary new technologies embodied in \n, torpedo-boats and \n, of which the French at the time were probably the world's best exponents\".\n Japan acquired its first torpedoes in 1884, and established a \"Torpedo Training Center\" at Yokosuka in 1886.\n\n\nThese ships, ordered during the fiscal years 1885 and 1886, were the last major orders placed with France. The unexplained sinking of \n \n from France to Japan in December 1886, created embarrassment however.\n\n\nJapan turned again to Britain, with the order of a revolutionary torpedo boat, \n, which was considered the first effective design of a destroyer,\n in 1887 and with the purchase of \n, built at the \n works in \n, \n, the fastest cruiser in the world at the time of her launch in 1892.\n In 1889, she ordered the \n \n, which defined the type for \n.\n\n\nBetween 1882 and 1918, ending with the visit of the \n, the Imperial Japanese Navy stopped relying on foreign instructors altogether. In 1886, she manufactured her own \n, and in 1892 one of her officers invented a powerful explosive, the \n.\n\n\nJapan continued the modernization of its navy, especially as China was also building a powerful modern fleet with foreign, especially German, assistance, and as a result tensions were building between the two countries over Korea. The Japanese naval leadership on the eve of hostilities, was generally cautious and even apprehensive\n as the navy had not yet received the warships ordered in February 1893, particularly the battleships \n and \n and the cruiser \n.\n Hence, initiating hostilities at the time was not ideal, and the navy was far less confident than the Japanese army about the outcome of a war with China.\n\n\nJapan's main strategy was to gain command of the sea as this was critical to the operations on land. An early victory over the Beiyang fleet would allow Japan to transport troops and material to the Korean Peninsula, however any prolongation of the war would increase the risk of intervention by the European powers with interests in East Asia.\n The army's \n would land at Chemulpo on the western coast of Korea, both to engage and push Chinese forces northwest up the peninsula and to draw the Beiyang Fleet into the Yellow Sea, where it would be engaged in decisive battle. Depending upon the outcome of this engagement, Japan would make one of three choices; If the Combined Fleet were to win decisively, the larger part of the Japanese army would undertake immediate landings on the coast between \n and \n in order to defeat the Chinese army and bring the war to a swift conclusion. If the engagement were to be a draw and neither side gained control of the sea, the army would concentrate on the occupation of Korea. Lastly, if the Combined Fleet was defeated and consequently lost command of the sea, the bulk of the army would remain in Japan and prepare to repel a Chinese invasion, while the Fifth Division in Korea would be ordered to hang on and fight a rearguard action.\n\n\nA Japanese squadron intercepted and defeated a Chinese force near Korean island \n; damaging a cruiser, sinking a loaded transport, capturing one gunboat and destroying another.\n The battle occurred before \n was officially declared on 1 August 1894.\n On August 10, the Japanese ventured into the Yellow Sea to seek out the Beiyang Fleet and bombarded both \n and Port Arthur. Finding only small vessels in either harbor, the Combined Fleet returned to Korea to support further landings off the Chinese coast. The Beiyang Fleet under the command of Admiral Ding was initially ordered to stay close to the Chinese coast while reinforcements were sent to Korea by land. But as Japanese troops had very quickly advanced northward from Seoul to Pyongyang the Chinese decided to rush troops to Korea by sea under a naval escort, in mid-September.\n\nConcurrently, because there had been no decisive encounter at sea, the Japanese decided to send more troops to Korea. Early in September, the navy was directed to support further landings and to support the army on Korea's western coast. As Japanese ground forces then moved north to attack Pyongyang, Admiral Ito correctly guessed that the Chinese would attempt to reinforce their army in Korea by sea. On 14 September, the Combined Fleet went north to search the Korean and Chinese coasts and to bring the Beiyang Fleet to battle. On 17 September 1894, the Japanese encountered them off the mouth of the \n. The Combined Fleet then devastated the \n during the \n, in which the Chinese fleet lost eight out of 12 warships.\n The Chinese subsequently retreated behind the Weihaiwei fortifications. However, they were then surprised by Japanese troops, who outflanked the harbour's defenses in coordination with the navy.\n The remnants of the Beiyang Fleet were destroyed at \n. Although Japan turned out victorious, the two large German-made Chinese ironclad battleships (\n and \n) remained almost impervious to Japanese guns, highlighting the need for bigger capital ships in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The next step of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion would thus involve a combination of heavily armed large warships, with smaller and innovative offensive units permitting aggressive tactics.\n\n\nAs a result of the conflict, under the \n (April 17, 1895), \n and the \n were transferred to Japan.\n The Imperial Japanese Navy took possession of the island and quelled opposition movements between March and October 1895. Japan also obtained the \n, although she was forced by Russia, Germany and France to return it to China (\n), only to see Russia take possession of it soon after.\n\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy further intervened in China in 1900 by participating, together with Western Powers, in the suppression of the Chinese \n. The Navy supplied the largest number of warships (18 out of a total of 50) and delivered the largest contingent of troops among the intervening nations (20,840 Imperial Japanese Army and Navy soldiers, out of a total of 54,000).\n\n\nThe conflict allowed Japan to enter combat together with Western nations and to acquire first-hand understanding of their fighting methods.\n\n\nFollowing the war against China, the Triple Intervention under Russian leadership, pressured Japan to renounce its claim to the Liaodong Peninsula. The Japanese were well aware of the naval power the three countries possessed in East Asian waters, particularly Russia.\n Faced with little choice the Japanese retroceded the territory back to China for an additional 30 million taels (roughly ¥45 million). With the humiliation of the forced return of the Liaodong Peninsula, Japan began to build up its military strength in preparation for future confrontations.\n The political capital and public support for the navy gained as a result of the recent conflict with China, also encouraged popular and legislative support for naval expansion.\n\n\nIn 1895, \n was assigned to compose a study of Japan's future naval needs.\n He believed that Japan should have sufficient naval strength to not only to deal with a single hypothetical enemy separately, but to also confront any fleet from two combined powers that might be dispatched against Japan from overseas waters.\n He assumed that with their conflicting global interests, it was highly unlikely that the British and Russians would ever join together in a war against Japan,\n considering it more likely that a major power like Russia in alliance with a lesser naval power, would dispatch a portion of their fleet against Japan. Yamamoto therefore calculated that four battleships would be the main battle force that a major power could divert from their other naval commitments to use against Japan and he also added two more battleships that might be contributed to such a naval expedition by a lesser hostile power. In order to achieve victory Japan should have a force of six of the largest battleships supplemented by four armored cruisers of at least 7,000 tons.\n The centerpiece of this expansion was to be the acquisition of four new battleships in addition to the two which were already being completed in Britain being part of an earlier construction program. Yamamoto was also advocating the construction of a balanced fleet.\n \n\nBattleships would be supplemented by lesser warships of various types, including cruisers that could seek out and pursue the enemy and a sufficient number of destroyers and torpedo boats capable of striking the enemy in home ports. As a result, the program also included the construction of twenty-three destroyers, sixty-three torpedo boats, and an expansion of Japanese shipyards and repair and training facilities.\n In 1897, because of fears that the size of the Russian fleet assigned to East Asian waters could be larger than previously believed, the plan was revised. Although budgetary limitations simply could not permit the construction of another battleship squadron, the new \n and \n plates could resist all but the largest \n. Japan could now acquire armored cruisers that could take the place in the battle line. Hence, with new armor and lighter but more powerful quick-firing guns, this new cruiser type was superior to many older battleships still afloat.\n Subsequently, the revisions to the ten-year plan led to the four protected cruisers being replaced by an additional two armored cruisers. As a consequence the \n was born, with six battleships and six armored cruisers.\n\n\nThe program for a 260,000-ton navy to be completed over a ten-year period in two stages of construction, with the total cost being ¥280 million, was approved by the cabinet in late 1895 and funded by the Diet in early 1896.\n Of the total warship acquisitions accounted for just over ¥200 million.\n The first stage would begin in 1896 and be completed by 1902; the second would run from 1897 to 1905. The program was financed significantly from the Chinese indemnity secured after the First Sino-Japanese War.\n This was used to fund the bulk of the naval expansion, roughly ¥139 million, with public loans and existing government revenue providing the rest of the financing required over the ten years of the program.\n Japan's industrial resources at the time were inadequate for the construction of a fleet of armored warships domestically, as the country was still in the process of developing and acquiring the industrial infrastructure for the construction of major naval vessels. Consequently, the overwhelming majority was built in British shipyards.\n With the completion of the fleet, Japan would become the fourth strongest naval power in the world in a single decade.\n In 1902, Japan formed \n, the terms of which stated that if Japan went to war in the Far East and that a third power entered the fight against Japan, then Britain would come to the aid of the Japanese.\n This was a check to prevent any third power from intervening militarily in any future war with Russia.\n\nThe new fleet consisted of:\n\n\nOne of these battleships, \n, which was among the most powerful warships afloat when completed,\n was ordered from the \n shipyard in the United Kingdom at the end of 1898, for delivery to Japan in 1902. Commercial shipbuilding in Japan was exhibited by construction of the twin screw steamer \n, built for \n by the \n Dockyard & Engine Works, Nagasaki. The Imperial Japanese cruiser \n was built at the \n in \n, California.\n\n\nThese dispositions culminated with the \n. At the \n, Admiral Togo (flag in \n) led the Japanese Grand Fleet into the decisive engagement of the war.\n The Russian fleet was almost completely annihilated: out of 38 Russian ships, 21 were sunk, seven captured, six disarmed, 4,545 Russian servicemen died and 6,106 were taken prisoner. On the other hand, the Japanese only lost 116 men and three torpedo boats.\n These victories broke Russian strength in \n, and triggered waves of mutinies in the Russian Navy at \n, \n and \n, peaking in June with the \n, thereby contributing to the \n. The victory at Tsushima elevated the stature of the navy.\n\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy acquired its first submarines in 1905 from \n, barely four years after the US Navy had commissioned its own first submarine, \n. The ships were \n designs and were developed under the supervision of Electric Boat's representative, \n. These five submarines (known as Holland Type VII's) were shipped in kit form to Japan (October 1904) and then assembled at the Yokosuka, Kanagawa \n, to become hulls \n through \n, and became operational at the end of 1905.\n\n\nJapan continued in its efforts to build up a strong national naval industry. Following a strategy of \"copy, improve, innovate\",\n foreign ships of various designs were usually analysed in depth, their specifications often improved on, and then were purchased in pairs so as to organize comparative testing and improvements. Over the years, the importation of whole classes of ships was progressively substituted by local assembly, and then complete local production, starting with the smallest ships, such as torpedo boats and cruisers in the 1880s, to finish with whole battleships in the early 20th century. The last major purchase was in 1913 when the \n \n was purchased from the Vickers shipyard. By 1918, there was no aspect of shipbuilding technology where Japanese capabilities fell significantly below world standards.\n\n\nThe period immediately after Tsushima also saw the IJN, under the influence of the \n theoretician \n, adopt an explicit policy of building for a potential future conflict against the US Navy. Satō called for a battlefleet at least 70% as strong as that of the US. In 1907, the official policy of the Navy became an '\n' of eight modern battleships and eight battlecruisers. However, financial constraints prevented this ideal ever becoming a reality.\n\n\nBy 1920, the Imperial Japanese Navy was the world's third largest navy and a leader in naval development:\n\n \n on the side of the \n, against \n and \n, as a consequence of the 1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance. In the \n, the Imperial Japanese Navy helped seize the German colony at \n. During the siege, beginning on 5 September 1914, \n conducted the world's first successful sea-launched air strikes. On 6 September 1914, in the very first air-sea battle in history, a Farman aircraft launched by \n attacked the Austro-Hungarian cruiser \n and the German gunboat \n off \n.\n from \n. Four \n seaplanes bombarded German land targets like communication and command centers, and damaged a German minelayer in the Tsingtao peninsula from September to 6 November 1914 when the Germans surrendered.\n\n\nA battle group was also sent to the central Pacific in August and September to pursue the German \n, which then moved into the Southern Atlantic, where it encountered British naval forces and was destroyed at the \n. Japan also seized German possessions in \n, which remained Japanese colonies until the end of World War II, under the \n' \n.\n Hard pressed in Europe, where she had only a narrow margin of superiority against Germany, Britain had requested, but was denied, the loan of Japan's four newly built \n battlecruisers (\n, \n, \n, and \n), some of the first ships in the world to be equipped with 356 mm (14 in) guns, and the most formidable battlecruisers in the world at the time.\n\n\nFollowing a further request by the British and the initiation of \n by Germany, in March 1917, the Japanese sent a \n to the Mediterranean. This force, consisted of one protected cruiser, \n as \n and eight of the Navy's newest \n (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n), under Admiral Satō Kōzō, was based in \n and efficiently protected allied shipping between \n, \n, and ports in \n until the end of the War.\n In June, \n was replaced by \n, and four more destroyers were added (\n, \n, \n, and \n). They were later joined by the cruiser \n. By the end of the war, the Japanese had escorted 788 allied transports. One destroyer, \n, was torpedoed on 11 June 1917 by a German submarine with the loss of 59 officers and men. A memorial at the Kalkara Naval Cemetery in Malta was dedicated to the 72 Japanese sailors who died in action during the Mediterranean convoy patrols.\n\n\nIn 1917, Japan exported 12 \n to France. In 1918, ships such as \n were assigned to \n escort in the \n between \n and the \n as part of Japan's contribution to the war effort under the \n. After the conflict, the Japanese Navy received seven German submarines as spoils of war, which were brought to Japan and analysed, contributing greatly to the development of the Japanese submarine industry.\n\n\nBy 1921, Japan's naval expenditure reached nearly 32% of the national government budget. \n\nIn the years following after the end of First World War the naval construction programs of the three greatest naval powers Britain, Japan and the United States had threatened to set off a new potentially dangerous and expensive naval arms race.\n The subsequent Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 became one of history's most effective arms reduction programs,\n setting up a system of ratios between the five signatory powers. The United States and Britain were each allocated 525,000 tons of capital ships, Japan 315,000, and France and Italy to 175,000, ratios of 5:3:1.75.\n Also agreed to was a ten-year moratorium on battleship construction, though replacement of battleships reaching 20 years of service was permitted. Maximum limits of 35,000 tons and 16-inch guns were also set. Carriers were restricted with the same 5:5:3 ratio, with Japan allotted 81,000 tons.\n\n\nMany naval leaders in Japan's delegation were outraged by these limitations, as Japan would always be behind its chief rivals. However, in the end it was concluded that even these unfavorable limitations would be better than an unrestricted arms race with the industrially dominant United States.\n The Washington System may have made Japan a junior partner with the US and Britain, but it also curtailed the rise of China and the Soviet Union, who both sought to challenge Japan in Asia.\n\n\nThe Washington Treaty did not restrict the building of ships other than battleships and carriers, resulting in a building race for heavy cruisers. These were limited to 10,000 tons and 8-inch guns.\n The Japanese were also able to get some concessions, most notably the battleship \n,\n which had been partly funded by donations from schoolchildren and would have been scrapped under the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe Treaty also dictated that the United States, Britain, and Japan could not expand their Western Pacific fortifications. Japan specifically could not militarize the Kurile Islands, the Bonin Islands, Amami-Oshima, the Loochoo Islands, Formosa and the Pescadores.\n\n\nJapan at times continued to solicit foreign expertise in areas in which the IJN was inexperienced, such as naval aviation. The Japanese navy had closely monitored the progress of aviation of the three Allied naval powers during World War I and concluded that Britain had made the greatest advances in naval aviation,.\n The \n led by \n, a former officer in the \n experienced in the design and testing of Royal Navy aircraft during the First World War.\n The mission consisted of 27 members, who were largely personnel with experience in naval aviation and included pilots and engineers from several British aircraft manufacturing firms.\n The British technical mission left for Japan in September with the objective of helping the Imperial Japanese Navy develop and improve the proficiency of its naval air arm.\n The mission arrived at Kasumigaura Naval Air Station the following month, in November 1921, and stayed in Japan for 18 months.\n\n\nThe mission brought to Kasumigaura well over a hundred British aircraft comprising twenty different models, five of which were then currently in service with the Royal Navy's \n. The Japanese were trained on several, such as the \n, then a frontline fighter. The Japanese would go on to order 50 of these aircraft from Gloster, and build 40.\n These planes eventually provided the inspiration for the design of a number of Japanese naval aircraft. Technicians become familiar with the newest aerial weapons and equipment-torpedoes, bombs, machine guns, cameras, and communications gear.\n \n\nThe mission also brought the plans of the most recent British aircraft carriers, such as HMS \n and HMS \n, which influenced the final stages of the development of the carrier \n. By the time its last members had returned to Britain, the Japanese had acquired a reasonable grasp of the latest aviation technology and taken the first steps toward having an effective naval air force.\n Japanese naval aviation also, both in technology and in doctrine, continued to be dependent on the British model for most of the 1920s.\n\n\nBetween the wars, Japan took the lead in many areas of warship development:\n\nThe Imperial Japanese Navy was faced before and during World War II with considerable challenges, probably more so than any other navy in the world.\n Japan, like Britain, was almost entirely dependent on foreign resources to supply its economy. To achieve Japan's expansionist policies, IJN had to secure and protect distant sources of raw material (especially Southeast Asian oil and raw materials), controlled by foreign countries (Britain, France, and \n). To achieve this goal, she had to build large warships capable of long range assault. In the \n \n, the IJN began to structure itself specifically to fight the United States. A long stretch of \n expansion and the start of the \n in 1937 had exacerbated tensions with the United States, which was seen as a rival of Japan.\n\nThis was in conflict with Japan's doctrine of \"decisive battle\" (\n, \n, which did not require long range),\n in which IJN would allow the US to sail across the Pacific, using submarines to damage it, then engage the US Navy in a \"decisive battle area\" near Japan after inflicting such \n.\n This is also in keeping with the theory of \n, to which every major navy subscribed before World War II, in which wars would be decided by engagements between opposing surface fleets.\n\n\nFollowing the dictates of Satō (who doubtless was influenced by Mahan),\n it was the basis for Japan's demand for a 70% ratio (10:10:7) at the \n, which would give Japan superiority in the \"decisive battle area\", and the US' insistence on a 60% ratio, which meant parity.\n \n\nIt was also in conflict with her past experience. Japan's numerical and industrial inferiority led her to seek technical superiority (fewer, but faster, more powerful ships), qualitative superiority (better training), and aggressive tactics (daring and speedy attacks overwhelming the enemy, a recipe for success in her previous conflicts), but failed to take account of any of these traits. Her opponents in any future \n would not face the political and geographical constraints of her previous wars, nor did she allow for losses in ships and crews.\n\n\nDuring the pre-war years, two schools of thought battled over whether the navy should be organized around powerful battleships, ultimately able to defeat American ones in Japanese waters, or aircraft carriers. Neither really prevailed, and both types were developed. \n\nA consistent weakness of gunned Japanese warship development was the tendency to incorporate too much armament, and too much engine power, relative to ship size (a side-effect of the Washington Treaty limitations on overall tonnage), leading to shortcomings in stability, protection and structural strength.\n\n\nIn response to the \n, the Japanese started a series of naval construction programs or \n (\n), known unofficially as the \n (\n). Between 1930 and the outbreak of the Second World War there were four of these \n which were drawn up in 1931, 1934, 1937, and 1939.\n The \n was plan approved in 1931, provided for the construction of 39 ships to be laid down between 1931 and 1934, centering on four of the new \n \n,\n and expansion of the \n to 14 Air Groups. However, plans for a second \n were delayed by the \n capsizing and heavy typhoon damage to the \n, when it was revealed that the basic designs of many Japanese warships were flawed due to poor construction techniques and instability caused by attempting to mount too much weaponry on too small a displacement hull.\n As a result, most of the naval budget in 1932–1933 was absorbed in modifications to rectify the issues with existing equipment.\n\n\nIn 1934, the \n plan was approved, covering the construction of 48 new warships including the \n and two carriers: \n and \n. The plan also continued the buildup in naval aircraft and authorized the creation of eight new Naval Air Groups. With Japan's renunciation of naval treaties in December 1934, \n plan was approved in 1937, its third major naval building program since 1930.\n A six-year effort, it called for construction of new warships that were free from the old treaty restrictions, while concentrating on qualitative superiority to compensate for Japan's quantitative deficiencies compared with the United States. While the core of \n was to be the construction of the two battleships \n and \n, it also called for building the two \n aircraft carrier, along with sixty-four other warships in other categories.\n \n also called for the rearming of the demilitarized battlecruiser \n and the refitting of her sister ships, \n, \n, and \n.\n Also funded was upgrading of the four \n-class cruisers and the two \n class cruisers, which were under construction, by replacing their 6-inch main batteries with 8-inch guns.\n In aviation, \n aimed at maintaining parity with American naval air power by adding 827 planes for allocation to fourteen planned land-based air groups, and increasing carrier aircraft by nearly 1,000. To accommodate the new land aircraft the plan called for several new airfields to be built or expanded; it also provided for a significant increase in the size of the navy's production facilities for aircraft and aerial weapons.\n\n\nIn 1938, with the construction of \n under way, the Japanese had begun to consider preparations for the next major expansion, which was scheduled for 1940. However, with the American \n in 1938, the Japanese accelerated the \n six-year expansion program, which was approved in September 1939.\n \n goal was doubling Japan's naval air strength in just five years, delivering air superiority in East Asia and the western Pacific.\n It called for building of two \n battleship, a fleet carrier, six of a new class of planned escort carriers, six cruisers, twenty-two destroyers, and twenty-five submarines. \n\n\n\nThe Second Sino-Japanese War was of great importance and value to the development of Japanese naval aviation, demonstrating how aircraft could contribute to the projection of naval power ashore.\n\n\nThe IJN had two primary responsibilities during it: to support amphibious operations on the Chinese coast and the strategic aerial bombardment of Chinese cities\n – the first time any naval air arm had been given such tasks.\n\n\nFrom the onset of hostilities in 1937 until forces were diverted to combat for the Pacific war in 1941, naval aircraft played a key role in military operations on the Chinese mainland. These began with attacks on military installations largely in the Yangtze River basin along the Chinese coast by Japanese carrier aircraft.\n Naval involvement during the conflict peaked in 1938–39 with the heavy bombardment of Chinese cities deep in the interior by land-based medium bombers and concluded during 1941 with an attempt by both, carrier-borne and land-based, tactical aircraft to cut communication and transportation routes in southern China. Although, the 1937–41 air offensives failed in their political and psychological aims, they did reduce the flow of strategic materiel to China and for a time improved the Japanese military situation in the central and southern parts of the country.\n\n\nTo effectively combat the numerically superior American navy, the Japanese had devoted a large amount of resources to create a force of superior quality.\n Betting on the success of aggressive tactics which stemmed from \n and the concept of decisive battle,\n Japan did not invest significantly in capabilities needed to protect its long shipping lines against enemy submarines,\n particularly under-investing in the vital area of \n (both escort ships and \n), and in the specialized training and organization to support it.\n Imperial Japan's reluctance to use its \n fleet for commerce raiding and failure to secure its communications also hastened its defeat.\n The Japanese Navy also underinvested in intelligence and had hardly any agents active in the United States when the war started; several Japanese Naval officers credited lack of information about the US Navy as another major factor in their defeat.\n\n\nThe IJN launched a surprise \n, killing 2,403 Americans and crippling the US Pacific Fleet.\n During the first six months of the Pacific War, the IJN enjoyed spectacular success inflicting heavy defeats on Allied forces.\n Allied navies were devastated during the Japanese conquest of Southeast Asia.\n Japanese naval aircraft were also responsible for the \n which was the first time that capital ships were sunk by aerial attack while underway.\n In April 1942, the \n drove the Royal Navy from South East Asia.\n\n\nAfter these successes, the IJN now concentrated on the elimination and neutralization of strategic points from where the Allies could launch counteroffensives against Japanese conquests.\n However, at \n the Japanese were forced to abandon their attempts to isolate Australia\n while the defeat in the \n saw the Japanese forced on the defensive. The \n, in which the Japanese lost the war of attrition, was the most decisive; the Japanese failed to commit enough forces in sufficient time.\n During 1943 the Allies were able to reorganize their forces and American industrial strength began to turn the tide of the war.\n American forces ultimately managed to gain the upper hand through a vastly greater industrial output and a modernization of its air and naval forces.\n\n\nIn 1943, the Japanese also turned their attention to the defensive perimeters of their previous conquests. Forces on Japanese held islands in Micronesia were to absorb and wear down an expected American counteroffensive.\n However, American industrial power become apparent and the military forces that faced the Japanese in 1943 were overwhelming in firepower and equipment.\n From the end of 1943 to 1944 Japan's defensive perimeter failed to hold.\n\n\nThe defeat at the \n was a disaster for Japanese naval air power with American pilots terming the slanted air/sea battle the \n, mostly going in the favor of the US,\n while the \n led to the destruction of a large part of the surface fleet.\n During the last phase of the war, the Imperial Japanese Navy resorted to a series of desperate measures, including a variety of \n which were popularly called \n.\n By May 1945, most of the Imperial Japanese Navy had been sunk and the remnants had taken refuge in Japan's harbors.\n In late July 1945, most of the remaining large warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy were sunk in \n. By August 1945, \n was the only surviving \n of the Imperial Japanese Navy.\n\n\n units from 12th Air Fleet saw extensive action during \n and \n campaign in \n.\n\n\nFollowing Japan's surrender and subsequent occupation by the \n at the conclusion of World War II, the Imperial Japanese Navy, along with the rest of the Japanese military, was \n in 1945. In the new \n which was drawn up in 1947, \n specifies that \"The Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes.\"\n The prevalent view in Japan is that this article allows for military forces to be kept for the purposes of self-defense.\n \n\nIn 1952, the \n was formed within the Maritime Safety Agency, incorporating the minesweeping fleet and other military vessels, mainly destroyers, given by the United States. In 1954, the Safety Security Force was separated, and the JMSDF was formally created as the naval branch of the Japanese Self-Defense Force (JSDF), following the passage of the 1954 Self-Defense Forces Law. Japan's current navy falls under the umbrella of the \n (JSDF) as the \n (JMSDF).\n\n"},

The island's name was given by Spanish explorer \n during his maritime expedition of 1545 due to the resemblance of the indigenous peoples of the island to those in the  \n.\n\n\nThe eastern half of the island is the major land mass of the independent nation of \n. The western half, known as \n,\n forms a part of \n and is organized as the provinces of \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n. The two major cities on the island are \n and \n.\n\nThe island has been known by various names:\n\nThe name \n was used to refer to parts of the island before contact with the West.\n Its etymology is unclear;\n one theory states that it derived from \n, the language used by the \n.\n An expedition by the \n, together with Sahmardan, the \n of \n, and the Papuan \n, managed to conquer some areas in New Guinea, which was then reorganised to form \n (\"Four Kings\") or \n, \n (\n \"The Papua Nine \n\"), and \n (\n The \n \"Four \n\"). The name comes from the words \n (\"to unite\") and \n (negation), which means \"not united\", i.e. an outlying possession of Tidore.\n\n\nAnton Ploeg reports that the word \n is often said to be derived from the \n word \n or \n, meaning \"frizzly-haired\", referring to the very curly hair of the island's inhabitants.\n However Sollewijn Gelpke in 1993 considered this unlikely as it had been used earlier, and he instead derived it from the \n phrase \n, which means \"the land below [the sunset]\", and refers to the \n.\n\nWhen Portuguese and Spanish explorers arrived via the \n, they also used the name \n.\n However, Westerners, beginning with Spanish explorer \n in 1545, used the name \n, due to the resemblance between the indigenous peoples of the island and Africans of the \n.\n The name is one of several \n sharing similar \n, ultimately meaning \"land of the blacks\" or similar meanings.\n\nThe Dutch, who arrived later under \n and \n, called it \n. They later used this name only to refer to islands off the north coast of Papua proper, the \n or Biak Island. When the Dutch colonized the main island as part of the \n, they called it \n.\n\n\nThe name \n was used in the Indonesian language to refer to the island and Indonesian province, as \n (West Irian) Province and later \n Province. The name Irian was suggested during a tribal committee meeting in Tobati, Jayapura, formed by \n under governor JP van Eechoed, to decide on a new name because of the negative association of \n. \n, the committee leader, suggested the name from Mansren Koreri myths, \n from the \n of \n, meaning \"hot land\" (referring to the climate), but also from \n which means heated process as a metaphor for a land that is entering a new era. In Serui \n (\n \"land-nation\") means \"pillar of nation\", while in Merauke \n (\n \"placed higher-nation\") means \"rising spirit\" or \"to rise\".\n The name was promoted in 1945 by Marcus Kaisiepo, brother of \n.\n The name was politicized later by Corinus Krey,\n \n, \n, and others with the \n \n \n (\"Join the Republic of Indonesia Oppose the Netherlands\").\n \n was used somewhat in 1972.\n The name was used until 2001, when \n was again used for the island and the province. The name \n, which was originally favored by natives, is now considered to be a name imposed by the authority of \n.\n\n\nNew Guinea is an island to the north of the \n, south of the equator. It is isolated by the \n to the west, and the \n and \n to the east. Sometimes considered to be the easternmost island of the \n, it lies north of Australia's \n, the \n and \n, and west of the \n and the \n.\n\nPolitically, the \n comprises six \n: \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n. The eastern half forms the mainland of the country of \n.\n\n The shape of New Guinea is often compared to that of a \n (indigenous to the island), and this results in the usual names for the two extremes of the island: the \n in the northwest (\n in Dutch, \n in Indonesian; also known as the Doberai Peninsula), and the Bird's Tail Peninsula in the southeast (also known as the \n).\n\nA spine of east–west mountains, the \n, dominates the geography of New Guinea, stretching over 1,600 km (1,000 mi) across the island, with many mountains over 4,000 m (13,100 ft). The western half of the island contains the highest mountains in \n, with its highest point, \n, reaching an elevation of 4,884 m (16,023 ft). The \n is around 4,000 m (13,100 ft) elevation, and the tallest peaks contain equatorial \n—which have been \n.\n Various other smaller mountain ranges occur both north and west of the central ranges. Except in high elevations, most areas possess a warm humid climate throughout the year, with some seasonal variation associated with the northeast monsoon season.\n\nAnother major habitat feature is the vast southern and northern lowlands. Stretching for hundreds of kilometres, these include lowland rainforests, extensive wetlands, savanna grasslands, and some of the largest expanses of mangrove forest in the world. The southern lowlands are the site of \n, a \n \n. The northern lowlands are drained principally by the \n and its tributaries on the western side, and by the \n on the eastern side. The more extensive southern lowlands are drained by a larger number of rivers, principally the \n in the west and the \n in the east. The largest island offshore, \n, lies near the Digul estuary, separated by a strait so narrow it has been named a \"creek\".\n\nNew Guinea contains many of the world's ecosystem types: glacial, \n, \n, \n and lowland rainforest, \n, \n, lake and \n, \n, and some of the richest \n on the planet.\n\nThe entire length of the \n system passes through New Guinea as a vast watershed. The northern rivers flow into the \n, the southern rivers into the \n and the \n. On the north side, the largest rivers are the Mamberamo, Sepik and Ramu.\n\n was born from the confluence of two large inland rivers. \n comes from the west to the east and \n from the east. These rivers meander through swamps with huge internal descents and then merge. The Mamberamo thus formed reaches the ocean by breaking through the Coastal Mountains. Mamberamo River is navigable to Marine Falls. The \n is a much more important river. Similarly, it collects water from a spacious pool. It is 1,100 kilometers from the \n to the estuary, making it the longest river in New Guinea. The winding, muddy, sluggish river can be navigated for 500 km. \n is a 650 km long river. Its lower section is navigable, but its upper flow is high-falling, fast-flowing. The energy of the river is used by a power plant near the city of \n.\n\nOn the south side, the most significant rivers are \n, Digul, Fly, \n and \n. The largest river in the western part of the island is \n. It originates from the \n, which rise to an altitude of 4,700 m. The coastal plain is bordered by a swamp world hundreds of kilometers wide. Digul is the main transport route to the fertile hills and mountains within the island. The river \n is born near the eastern branches of the Digul. It is named after one of the ships of the English Royal Fleet, which first sailed into the mouth of the river in 1845. The total length of the river is 1,050 km. Smaller boats can sail 900 km on the river. The estuary section, which decomposes into islands, is 70 km wide. The tide of the sea can have an effect of up to 300 kilometers. \n, a tributary of the Fly, reaches the Papuan Plain through wild gorges. Fly and Strickland together form the largest river in New Guinea. The many rivers flowing into the \n form a single delta complex. The rivers of the island are extremely rich in water due to the annual rainfall of 2,000–10,000 mm. According to a modest calculation, the New Guinea River carries about 1,500 km\n/a (48,000 m\n/s) of water into the sea. Fly alone carries more water 238 km\n/a (7,500 m\n/s) than all the rivers in \n combined.\n\n\nThe island of New Guinea lies to the east of the \n, with which it is sometimes included as part of a greater Indo-Australian Archipelago.\n Geologically it is a part of the same \n as Australia. When world sea levels were low, the two shared shorelines (which now lie 100 to 140 metres below sea level),\n and combined with lands now inundated into the tectonic continent of \n,\n also known as Greater Australia.\n The two landmasses became separated when the area now known as the Torres Strait flooded after the end of the \n.\n\nAnthropologically, New Guinea is considered part of \n.\n\n\nNew Guinea is differentiated from its drier, flatter,\n and less fertile\n southern counterpart, Australia, by its much higher rainfall and its active volcanic geology. Yet the two land masses share a similar animal fauna, with \n, including \n and \n, and the egg-laying \n, the \n. Other than bats and some two dozen indigenous rodent genera,\n there are no pre-human indigenous \n. Pigs, several additional species of rats, and the ancestor of the \n were introduced with human colonization.\n\nPrior to the 1970s, archaeologists called the single \n landmass by the name \n,\n although this word is most often used for a wider region that includes lands, such as \n, which are not on the same continental shelf. In the early 1970s, they introduced the term \n for the Pleistocene continent.\n Then, at a 1975 conference and consequent publication,\n they extended the name \n from its previous use for just the Sahul Shelf to cover the continent.\n\n\nThe island of New Guinea is \n into roughly equal halves across a north–south line:\n\nThe current population of the island of New Guinea is about fifteen million. Archaeological evidence indicates that humans may have inhabited the island continuously since 50,000 BCE,\n and first settlement possibly dating back to 60,000 years ago has been proposed. The island is presently populated by almost a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. \n's 14th edition lists 826 languages of \n and 257 languages of \n, total 1073 languages, with 12 languages overlapping.\n They can be divided into two groups, the \n, and all the others placed in the catch-all category of \n, most of which are unrelated.\n\n\nThe separation is not merely linguistic; \n among societies was a factor in the evolution of the \n: separate housing for groups of adult men, away from the single-family houses of women and children.\n Pig-based trade between groups and pig-based feasts form a common tradition with the other peoples of southeast Asia and Oceania. Most Papuan societies practice agriculture, supplemented by hunting and gathering.\n\nCurrent evidence indicates that the Papuans (who constitute the majority of the island's peoples) are descended from the earliest human inhabitants of New Guinea. These original inhabitants first arrived in New Guinea at a time around the \n (c.  21,000 years ago) when the island was connected to the Australian continent via a \n, forming the landmass of \n. These peoples had made the (shortened) sea-crossing from the islands of \n and \n (the present \n) by at least 40,000 years ago.\n\nThe ancestral Austronesian peoples are believed to have arrived considerably later, approximately 3,500 years ago, as part of a gradual seafaring migration from \n, possibly originating in Taiwan. Austronesian-speaking peoples colonized many of the offshore islands to the north and east of New Guinea, such as \n and \n, with settlements also on the coastal fringes of the main island in places. Human habitation of New Guinea over tens of thousands of years has led to a great deal of diversity, which was further increased by the later arrival of the Austronesians and the more recent history of European and Asian settlement through events like \n.\n\nLarge areas of New Guinea are yet to be explored by scientists and anthropologists. The Indonesian province of \n is home to an estimated 44 \n.\n\n\nWith some 786,000 km\n of tropical land—less than one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the Earth's surface—New Guinea has an immense \n, containing between 5 and 10 percent of the total species on the planet. This percentage is about the same amount as that found in the United States or Australia. A high percentage of New Guinea's species are \n, and thousands are still unknown to science: probably well over 200,000 species of insect, between 11,000 and 20,000 plant species, and over 650 resident bird species. Most of these species are shared, at least in their origin, with the continent of Australia, which was until fairly recent geological times part of the same landmass (see \n for an overview). The island is so large that it is considered 'nearly a continent' in terms of its biological distinctiveness.\n\nIn the period from 1998 to 2008, conservationists identified 1,060 new species in New Guinea, including 218 plants, 43 reptiles, 12 mammals, 580 invertebrates, 134 amphibians, 2 birds and 71 fish.\n Between 2011 and 2017, researchers described 465 previously undocumented plant species in New Guinea.\n As of 2019, the Indonesian portion of New Guinea and the Maluku Islands is estimated to have 9,518 species of vascular plants, of which 4,380 are endemic. In 2020, an international study conducted by a team of 99 experts cataloged 13,634 species representing 1,742 genera and 264 families of vascular plants for New Guinea and its associated islands (\n, \n, \n, \n), making it the world's most floristically diverse island, surpassing \n (11,488), \n (11,165), \n (4,598), and \n (9,432).\n\n\n, New Guinea is part of \n rather than the \n realm, although New Guinea's flora has many more affinities with Asia than its fauna, which is overwhelmingly Australian. Botanically, New Guinea is considered part of \n, a floristic region that extends from the \n across Indonesia to New Guinea and the \n. The flora of New Guinea is a mixture of many \n species with origins in Asia, together with typically Australasian flora. Typical Southern Hemisphere flora include the \n \n and the rainforest emergents \n and \n as well as \n and several species of \n.\n\nNew Guinea has 284 species and six orders of mammals: \n, three orders of \n, \n and \n; 195 of the mammal species (69%) are endemic. New Guinea has 578 species of breeding birds, of which 324 species are endemic. The island's frogs are one of the most poorly known vertebrate groups, totalling 282 species, but this number is expected to double or even triple when all species have been documented. New Guinea has a rich diversity of coral life and 1,200 species of fish have been found. Also about 600 species of reef-building coral—the latter equal to 75 percent of the world's known total. The entire coral area covers 18 million hectares off a peninsula in northwest New Guinea.\n\nAs of 2020, the Western portion of New Guinea, Papua and West Papua, accounts for 54% of the island's primary forest and about 51% of the island's total tree cover, according to satellite data.\n\n\nAccording to the \n, New Guinea can be divided into twelve \n:\n\n\nThe \n and \n divide New Guinea into five \n:\n\n\nThe WWF and Nature Conservancy identify several \n in the seas bordering New Guinea:\n\n\nThe first inhabitants \n, from whom the Papuan people are probably descended, adapted to the range of ecologies and, in time, developed one of the earliest known agricultures. Remains of this agricultural system, in the form of ancient irrigation systems in the highlands of Papua New Guinea, are being studied by archaeologists. Research indicates that the highlands were an early and independent center of agriculture, with evidence of irrigation going back at least 10,000 years.\n \n was cultivated in New Guinea around 6000 BCE.\n\n\nThe gardens of the \n are ancient, intensive \n, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000 mm per year (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. Complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages are used in rotation on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Western agronomists still do not understand all of the practices, and it has been noted that native gardeners are as, or even more, successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops.\n There is evidence that New Guinea gardeners invented crop rotation well before western Europeans.\n A unique feature of New Guinea permaculture is the \n of \n, a tall, sturdy native \n tree, suited to use for timber and fuel, with root nodules that fix nitrogen. \n show that it was adopted during an ancient period of extreme deforestation.\n\nIn more recent millennia, another wave of people arrived on the shores of New Guinea. These were the \n, who had spread down from \n, through the \n, colonising many of the islands on the way. The Austronesian people had technology and skills extremely well adapted to ocean voyaging and Austronesian language speaking people are present along much of the coastal areas and islands of New Guinea. They also introduced pigs and \n. These Austronesian migrants are considered the ancestors of most people in insular Southeast Asia, from \n and \n to \n and \n, as well as coastal new Guinea.\n\n\nThe western part of the island was in contact with kingdoms in other parts of modern-day Indonesia. The \n mentioned the region of Wanin and Sran, in eastern \n as part of \n's tributary. This 'Wanin' has been identified with the Onin Peninsula, part of the \n near the city of \n.\n while '\n' had been identified as region of \n, just south of Onin peninsula.\n The sultans of \n, in the \n, claimed sovereignty over various coastal parts of the island.\n During Tidore's rule, the main exports of the island during this period were resins, spices, slaves and the highly priced feathers of the \n. In a period of constant conflict called 'hongi wars', in which rival villages or kingdoms would invoke the name of Tidore Sultan, rightly, for punitive expeditions for not fulfilling their tributary obligations, or opportunitively for competitions over resources and prestige.\n \n, one of the most famous Tidore sultans who rebelled against Dutch colonization, called himself \"Sultan of Tidore and Papua\",\n during his revolt in 1780s. He commanded loyalty from both Moluccan and Papuan chiefs, especially those of \n Islands, from his base in \n. Following Tidore's subjugation as Dutch tributary, much of the territory it claimed in western part of New Guinea came under Dutch rule as part of Dutch East Indies.\n\n\nThe first European contact with New Guinea was by Portuguese and Spanish sailors in the 16th century. In 1526–27, Portuguese explorer \n saw the western tip of New Guinea and named it \n. In 1528, the Spanish navigator \n also recorded its sighting when trying to return from \n to \n. In 1545, Spaniard \n sailed along the north coast of New Guinea as far as the \n, near which he landed on 20 June, naming the island 'Nueva Guinea'.\n The first map showing the whole island (as an island) was published in 1600\n and shows it as 'Nova Guinea'. In 1606, \n explored the southern coast of New Guinea from \n to the \n including \n, which he named \n. His expedition also discovered \n naming it \n, which he claimed for Spain in July 1606.\n On 18 October, his expedition reached the western part of the island in present-day Indonesia, and also claimed the territory for the King of Spain.\n\nA successive European claim occurred in 1828, when the Netherlands formally claimed the western half of the island as \n. Dutch colonial authority built \n an administrative and trading post established near Lobo, Triton Bay, but by 1835 had been abandoned.\n Considering that New Guinea had little economic value for them, the Dutch promoted Tidore as suzerain of Papua. By 1849, Tidore's borders had been extended to the proximity of the current international border between Indonesia and \n, as it formed extensive trade pact and custom of \n ( federation of nine ).\n\n\nIn 1883, following a short-lived French annexation of \n, the British colony of \n annexed south-eastern New Guinea. However, the Queensland government's superiors in the \n revoked the claim, and (formally) assumed direct responsibility in 1884, when \n claimed north-eastern New Guinea as the protectorate of \n (also called \n).\n\nThe first Dutch government posts were established in 1898 and in 1902: Manokwari on the north coast, Fak-Fak in the west and Merauke in the south at the border with \n. The German, Dutch and British colonial administrators each attempted to suppress the still-widespread practices of inter-village warfare and \n within their respective territories.\n\n\nIn 1905, the British government transferred some administrative responsibility over southeast New Guinea to Australia (which renamed the area \"\n\"); and, in 1906, transferred all remaining responsibility to Australia. During \n, Australian forces seized German New Guinea, which in 1920 became the \n, to be administered by Australia under a \n \n. The territories under Australian administration became collectively known as The Territories of Papua and New Guinea (until February 1942).\n\nBefore about 1930, European maps showed the highlands as uninhabited forests.\n When first flown over by aircraft, numerous settlements with agricultural terraces and stockades were observed. The most startling discovery took place on 4 August 1938, when \n discovered the \n of the Baliem River, which had 50,000 yet-undiscovered Stone Age farmers living in orderly villages. The people, known as the \n, were the last society of its size to make first contact with the rest of the world.\n A 1930 expedition led by the prospector Michael Lehay also encountered an indigenous group in the highlands. The inhabitants, believing themselves to be the only people in the world and, having never seen Europeans before, initially believed the explorers to be spirits of the dead due to the local belief that a person's skin turned white when they died and crossed into the land of the dead.\n\n\nNetherlands New Guinea and the Australian territories  (the eastern half ) were invaded in 1942 by the \n.   The Netherlands were defeated by that stage and did not put up a fight, and  the western section  was not of any strategic value to  either side, so they did not battle there.   The Japanese invaded the north shore of the Australia territories and were aiming to move south and take the southern shore too. The highlands, northern and eastern parts of the island became key battlefields in the \n of \n.  Notable battles were for  Port Moresby (the naval battle is known as  the Battle of the Coral Sea),   Milne Bay and for the Kakoda track.  Papuans often gave vital assistance to the \n, fighting alongside Australian troops, and carrying equipment and injured men across New Guinea. Approximately 216,000 Japanese, Australian and U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen died during the New Guinea Campaign.\n\n\nFollowing the return to civil administration after World War II, the Australian section was known as the Territory of Papua-New Guinea from 1945 to 1949 and then as \n. Although the rest of the Dutch East Indies achieved independence as Indonesia on 27 December 1949, the Netherlands regained control of western New Guinea.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Dutch government began to prepare Netherlands New Guinea for full independence and allowed elections in 1959; the partial elected \n took office on 5 April 1961. The Council decided on the name of West Papua (\n) for the territory, along with an emblem, \n, and \n to complement those of the Netherlands. On 1 October 1962, after \n and negotiations, the Dutch handed over the territory to the \n, until 1 May 1963, when Indonesia took control. The territory was renamed West Irian (\n) and then Irian Jaya. In 1969, Indonesia, under the 1962 \n, organised a referendum named the \n, in which the military hand picked Papuan tribal elders to vote for integration with Indonesia.\n\n\nThere has been significant reported resistance to Indonesian integration and occupation,\n both through civil disobedience (such as publicly raising the Morning Star flag) and via the formation of the \n (OPM, or Free Papua Movement) in 1965.\n \n has estimated more than 100,000 Papuans, one-sixth of the population, have died as a result of government-sponsored violence against West Papuans.\n Reports published by \n and \n have put the number of killed Papuans since the start of the conflict at roughly 500,000.\n\n\nFrom 1971, the name Papua New Guinea was used for the Australian territory. On 16 September 1975, Australia granted full independence to Papua New Guinea. In 2000, Irian Jaya was formally renamed \"The Province of Papua\" and a Law on Special Autonomy was passed in 2001. The Law established a \n (MRP) with representatives of the different indigenous cultures of Papua. The MRP was empowered to protect the rights of Papuans, raise the status of women in Papua, and to ease religious tensions in Papua; \n were given for the implementation of the Law as much as $266 million in 2004.\n The \n' enforcement of the Law on Special Autonomy blocked further creation of subdivisions of Papua: although President \n was able to create a separate West Papua province in 2003 as a \n, plans for a third province on western New Guinea were blocked by the courts.\n Critics argue that the Indonesian government has been reluctant to establish or issue various government implementing regulations so that the legal provisions of special autonomy could be put into practice, and as a result special autonomy in Papua has \"failed\".\n\n\nIn 2022, the Indonesian Government split Papuan Province into four provinces. In addition to \n proper (capital \n), the three new provinces are \n (capital \n), \n (capital \n) and \n (capital \n).\n\n\nThe culture of \n and animosity between the neighboring tribes are still present in New Guinea.\n\n"},

It is a \n with the ability to \n onto the \n of the world, engage in forward deployments during peacetime and rapidly respond to regional crises, making it a frequent actor in American foreign and military policy.\n\nThe United States Navy is part of the \n, alongside the \n, which is its coequal sister service. The Department of the Navy is headed by the civilian \n. The Department of the Navy is itself a military department of the \n, which is headed by the \n. The \n (CNO) is the most senior Navy officer serving in the Department of the Navy.\n\n\nTo recruit, train, equip, and organize to deliver combat ready Naval forces to win conflicts and wars while maintaining security and deterrence through sustained forward presence.\nThe U.S. Navy is a seaborne branch of the \n. The Navy's three primary areas of responsibility:\n\n\nU.S. Navy training manuals state that the mission of the U.S. Armed Forces is \"to be prepared to conduct prompt and sustained combat operations in support of the national interest.\" The Navy's five enduring functions are: \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n\n\nIt follows then as certain as that night succeeds the day, that without a decisive naval force we can do nothing definitive, and with it, everything honorable and glorious.\nWould to Heaven we had a navy able to reform those enemies to mankind or crush them into non-existence.\nNaval power . . . is the natural defense of the United States.\nThe Navy was rooted in the colonial seafaring tradition, which produced a large community of sailors, captains, and shipbuilders.\n In the early stages of the \n, \n had its own \n. The rationale for establishing a national navy was debated in the \n \n. Supporters argued that a navy would protect shipping, defend the coast, and make it easier to seek support from foreign countries. Detractors countered that challenging the British \n, then the world's preeminent naval power, was a foolish undertaking. Commander in Chief \n resolved the debate when he commissioned the ocean-going \n \n to interdict British merchantmen and reported the captures to the Congress. On 13 October 1775, the Continental Congress authorized the purchase of two vessels to be armed for a cruise against British merchantmen; this resolution created the \n and is considered the first establishment of the U.S. Navy.\n The Continental Navy achieved mixed results; it was successful in a number of engagements and raided many British merchant vessels, but it lost twenty-four of its vessels\n and at one point was reduced to two in active service.\n In August 1785, after the Revolutionary War had drawn to a close, \n had sold \n, the last ship remaining in the Continental Navy due to a lack of funds to maintain the ship or support a navy.\n\n\nIn 1972, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral \n, authorized the Navy to celebrate its birthday on 13 October to honor the establishment of the Continental Navy in 1775.\n\n\nThe United States was without a navy for nearly a decade, a state of affairs that exposed U.S. maritime merchant ships to a series of attacks by the \n. The sole armed maritime presence between 1790 and the launching of the U.S. Navy's first warships in 1797 was the \n, the primary predecessor of the \n.

Due to his strong posture on having a strong standing Navy during this period, \n is \"often called the father of the American Navy\".\n In 1798–99 the Navy was involved in an undeclared \n with France.\n From 1801 to 1805, in the \n, the U.S. Navy defended U.S. ships from the Barbary pirates, blockaded the Barbary ports and executed attacks against the Barbary' fleets.\n\nThe U.S. Navy saw substantial action in the \n, where it was victorious in eleven single-ship duels with the Royal Navy. It proved victorious in the \n and prevented the region from becoming a threat to American operations in the area. The result was a major victory for the U.S. Army at the \n of the war, and the defeat of the Native American allies of the British at the \n. Despite this, the U.S. Navy could not prevent the British from blockading its ports and landing troops.\n But after the War of 1812 ended in 1815, the U.S. Navy primarily focused its attention on protecting American shipping assets, sending squadrons to the Caribbean, the Mediterranean, where it participated in the \n that ended piracy in the region, South America, Africa, and the Pacific.\n From 1819 to the outbreak of the Civil War, the \n operated to suppress the \n, seizing 36 slave ships, although its contribution was smaller than that of the much larger British Royal Navy. After 1840 several \n were southerners who advocated for strengthening southern naval defenses, expanding the fleet, and making naval technological improvements.\n\n\nDuring the \n the U.S. Navy blockaded Mexican ports, capturing or burning the Mexican fleet in the \n and capturing all major cities in \n peninsula. In 1846–1848 the Navy successfully used the \n under Commodore \n and its marines and blue-jackets to facilitate the capture of California with large-scale land operations coordinated with the local militia organized in the \n. The Navy conducted the U.S. military's first large-scale amphibious joint operation by successfully landing 12,000 army troops with their equipment in one day at \n, Mexico. When larger guns were needed to bombard Veracruz, Navy volunteers landed large guns and manned them in the successful bombardment and capture of the city. This successful landing and capture of Veracruz opened the way for the capture of Mexico City and the end of the war.\n The U.S. Navy established itself as a player in \n through the actions of \n \n in Japan, which resulted in the \n in 1854.\n\nNaval power played a significant role during the \n, in which the \n had a distinct advantage over the \n on the seas.\n A \n on all major ports shut down exports and the coastal trade, but blockade runners provided a thin lifeline. The \n components of the U.S. navy control of the river systems made internal travel difficult for Confederates and easy for the Union. The war saw \n in combat for the first time at the \n in 1862, which pitted \n against \n.\n For two decades after the war, however, the U.S. Navy's fleet was neglected and became \n.\n\n\nA modernization program beginning in the 1880s when the first steel-hulled warships stimulated the American steel industry, and \"the new steel navy\" was born.\n This rapid expansion of the U.S. Navy and its decisive victory over the outdated \n in 1898 brought a new respect for American technical quality. Rapid building of at first pre-dreadnoughts, then \n brought the U.S. in line with the navies of countries such as Britain and Germany. In 1907, most of the Navy's battleships, with several support vessels, dubbed the \n, were showcased in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world. Ordered by President \n, it was a mission designed to demonstrate the Navy's capability to extend to the global theater.\n By 1911, the U.S. had begun building the super-dreadnoughts at a pace to eventually become competitive with Britain.\n The 1911 also saw the first naval aircraft with the navy\n which would lead to the informal establishment of \n to protect shore bases. It was not until 1921 \n truly commenced.\n\nDuring \n, the U.S. Navy spent much of its resources protecting and shipping hundreds of thousands of soldiers and marines of the \n and war supplies across the Atlantic in \n infested waters with the \n. It also concentrated on laying the \n. Hesitation by the senior command meant that naval forces were not contributed until late 1917. \n was dispatched to Britain and served as the Sixth Battle Squadron of the British Grand Fleet. Its presence allowed the British to decommission some older ships and reuse the crews on smaller vessels. Destroyers and U.S. Naval Air Force units like the \n contributed to the anti-submarine operations. The strength of the United States Navy grew under an ambitious ship building program associated with the \n.\n\nNaval construction, especially of battleships, was limited by the \n of 1921–22, the first arms control conference in history. The aircraft carriers \n and \n were built on the hulls of partially built battle cruisers that had been canceled by the treaty. The \n used \n funds to build warships, such as \n and \n. By 1936, with the completion of \n, the U.S. Navy possessed a carrier fleet of 165,000 tonnes \n, although this figure was nominally recorded as 135,000 tonnes to comply with treaty limitations. \n, the number two official in the Navy Department during World War I, appreciated the Navy and gave it strong support. In return, senior leaders were eager for innovation and experimented with new technologies, such as magnetic torpedoes, and developed a strategy called \n for victory in the Pacific in a hypothetical war with Japan that would eventually become reality.\n\n\nThe U.S. Navy grew into a formidable force in the years prior to \n, with battleship production being restarted in 1937, commencing with \n. Though ultimately unsuccessful, Japan tried to neutralize this strategic threat with the surprise \n on 7 December 1941. Following American entry into the war, the U.S. Navy grew tremendously as the United States was faced with a two-front war on the seas. It achieved notable acclaim in the \n, where it was instrumental to the Allies' successful \"\n\" campaign.\n The U.S. Navy participated in many significant battles, including the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, and the \n. By 1943, the navy's size was larger than the combined fleets of all the other combatant nations in World War II.\n By war's end in 1945, the U.S. Navy had added hundreds of new ships, including 18 aircraft carriers and 8 battleships, and had over 70% of the world's total numbers and total tonnage of naval vessels of 1,000 tons or greater.\n At its peak, the U.S. Navy was operating 6,768 ships on \n in August 1945.\n\n\nDoctrine had significantly shifted by the end of the war. The U.S. Navy had followed in the footsteps of the navies of Great Britain and Germany which favored concentrated groups of battleships as their main offensive naval weapons.\n The development of the aircraft carrier and its devastating use by the Japanese against the U.S. at Pearl Harbor, however, shifted U.S. thinking. The Pearl Harbor attack destroyed or took out of action a significant number of U.S. Navy battleships. This placed much of the burden of retaliating against the Japanese on the small number of aircraft carriers.\n During World War II some 4,000,000 Americans served in the United States Navy.\n\n\nThe potential for armed conflict with the \n during the \n pushed the U.S. Navy to continue its technological advancement by developing new weapons systems, ships, and aircraft. U.S. naval strategy changed to that of forward deployment in support of U.S. allies with an emphasis on carrier battle groups.\n\n\nThe navy was a major participant in the \n, blockaded Cuba during the \n, and, through the use of \n, became an important aspect of the United States' \n policy. The U.S. Navy conducted various combat operations in the Persian Gulf against Iran in 1987 and 1988, most notably \n. The Navy was extensively involved in \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\n\nThe U.S. Navy has also been involved in search and rescue/search and salvage operations, sometimes in conjunction with vessels of other countries as well as with U.S. Coast Guard ships. Two examples are the \n incident and the subsequent search for missing hydrogen bombs, and Task Force 71 of the Seventh Fleet's operation in search for \n, shot down by the Soviets on 1 September 1983.\n\nThe U.S. Navy continues to be a major support to U.S. interests in the 21st century. Since the end of the Cold War, it has shifted its focus from preparations for large-scale war with the Soviet Union to special operations and strike missions in regional conflicts.\n The navy participated in \n, \n, and is a major participant in the ongoing \n, largely in this capacity. Development continues on new ships and weapons, including the \n aircraft carrier and the \n. Because of its size, weapons technology, and ability to project force far from U.S. shores, the current U.S. Navy remains an asset for the United States. Moreover, it is the principal means through which the U.S. maintains international global order, namely by safeguarding global trade and protecting allied nations.\n\n\nIn 2007, the U.S. Navy joined with the \n and U.S. Coast Guard to adopt a new maritime strategy called \n that raises the notion of prevention of war to the same philosophical level as the conduct of war. The strategy was presented by the \n, the \n, and \n at the International Sea Power Symposium in \n on 17 October 2007.\n\n\nThe strategy recognized the economic links of the global system and how any disruption due to regional crises (man-made or natural) can adversely impact the U.S. economy and quality of life. This new strategy charts a course for the Navy, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps to work collectively with each other and international partners to prevent these crises from occurring or reacting quickly should one occur to prevent negative impacts on the U.S.\n\nIn 2010, Admiral Gary Roughead, Chief of Naval Operations, noted that demands on the Navy have grown as the fleet has shrunk and that in the face of declining budgets in the future, the U.S. Navy must rely even more on international partnerships.\n\n\nIn its 2013 budget request, the navy focused on retaining all eleven big deck carriers, at the expense of cutting numbers of smaller ships and delaying the SSBN replacement.\n By the next year the USN found itself unable to maintain eleven aircraft carriers in the face of the expiration of budget relief offered by the \n and CNO \n said that a ten ship carrier fleet would not be able to sustainably support military requirements.\n The British \n \n said that\n the USN had switched from \"outcome-led to resource-led\" planning.\n\n\nOne significant change in U.S. policymaking that is having a major effect on naval planning is the \n. In response, the \n \n stated in 2015 that 60 percent of the total U.S. fleet will be deployed to the \n by 2020.\n The Navy's most recent 30-year shipbuilding plan, published in 2016, calls for a future fleet of 350 ships to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive international environment.\n A provision of the 2018 \n called for expanding the naval fleet to 355 ships \"as soon as practicable\", but did not establish additional funding nor a timeline.\n\n\nThe U.S. Navy falls under the administration of the \n, under civilian leadership of the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV). The most senior naval officer is the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO), a four-star admiral who is immediately under and reports to the Secretary of the Navy. At the same time, the Chief of Naval Operations is a member of the \n, which is the second-highest deliberative body of the armed forces after the \n, although it plays only an advisory role to the President and does not nominally form part of the \n. The Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations are responsible for organizing, recruiting, training, and equipping the Navy so that it is ready for operation under the commanders of the \n.\n\nThere are nine components in the operating forces of the U.S. Navy: the \n (formerly United States Atlantic Fleet), \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n. Fleet Forces Command controls a number of unique capabilities, including \n, \n, and \n.\n\nThe United States Navy has seven active numbered fleets – \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n are each led by a \n, and the \n is led by a \n. These seven fleets are further grouped under Fleet Forces Command (the former Atlantic Fleet), Pacific Fleet, Naval Forces Europe-Africa, and Naval Forces Central Command, whose commander also doubles as Commander Fifth Fleet; the first three commands being led by four-star admirals. The \n existed after World War II from 1947, but it was redesignated the Third Fleet in early 1973. The Second Fleet was deactivated in September 2011 but reestablished in August 2018 amid heightened tensions with Russia.\n It is headquartered in Norfolk, Virginia, with responsibility over the East Coast and North Atlantic.\n In early 2008, the Navy reactivated the Fourth Fleet to control operations in the area controlled by Southern Command, which consists of US assets in and around Central and South America.\n Other number fleets were activated during World War II and later deactivated, renumbered, or merged.\n\nShore establishments exist to support the mission of the fleet through the use of facilities on land. Among the commands of the shore establishment, as of April 2011\n, are the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, the \n, and the \n.\n Official Navy websites list the \n and the Chief of Naval Operations as part of the shore establishment, but these two entities effectively sit superior to the other organizations, playing a coordinating role.\n\n\nIn 1834, the \n came under the Department of the Navy.\n Historically, the Navy has had a unique relationship with the USMC, partly because they both specialize in seaborne operations. Together the Navy and Marine Corps form the Department of the Navy and report to the Secretary of the Navy. However, the Marine Corps is a distinct, separate service branch\n with its own uniformed service chief – the Commandant of the Marine Corps, a four-star general.\n\nThe Marine Corps depends on the Navy for medical support (dentists, \n, nurses, medical technicians known as \n) and religious support (chaplains). Thus, Navy officers and enlisted sailors fulfill these roles. When attached to Marine Corps units deployed to an operational environment they generally wear Marine camouflage uniforms, but otherwise, they wear Navy \n unless they opt to conform to Marine Corps grooming standards.\n\n\nIn the operational environment, as an expeditionary force specializing in amphibious operations, Marines often embark on Navy ships to conduct operations from beyond territorial waters. Marine units deploying as part of a Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) operate under the command of the existing Marine chain of command. Although Marine units routinely operate from amphibious assault ships, the relationship has evolved over the years much as the Commander of the Carrier Air Group/Wing (CAG) does not work for the carrier commanding officer, but coordinates with the ship's CO and staff. Some Marine aviation squadrons, usually fixed-wing assigned to carrier air wings train and operate alongside Navy squadrons; they fly similar missions and often fly sorties together under the cognizance of the CAG. Aviation is where the Navy and Marines share the most common ground since aircrews are guided in their use of aircraft by standard procedures outlined in a series of publications known as \n manuals.\n\nThe \n, in its peacetime role with the \n, fulfills its law enforcement and rescue role in the maritime environment. It provides \n (LEDETs) to Navy vessels, where they perform arrests and other law enforcement duties during naval boarding and interdiction missions. In times of war, the Coast Guard may be called upon to operate as a service in the Navy.\n At other times, Coast Guard \n are sent overseas to guard the security of ports and other assets. The Coast Guard also jointly staffs the Navy's naval coastal warfare groups and squadrons (the latter of which were known as harbor defense commands until late-2004), which oversee defense efforts in foreign littoral combat and inshore areas.\n\nThe United States Navy has over 400,000 personnel, approximately a quarter of whom are in ready reserve. Of those on active duty, more than eighty percent are \n sailors and around fifteen percent are \n; the rest are \n of the United States Naval Academy and midshipmen of the \n at over 180 universities around the country and officer candidates at the Navy's \n.\n\n\nEnlisted sailors complete basic military training at \n and then are sent to complete training for their individual \n.\n\n\nSailors prove they have mastered skills and deserve responsibilities by completing Personnel Qualification Standards (PQS) tasks and examinations. Among the most important is the \"warfare qualification\", which denotes a journeyman level of capability in Surface Warfare, Aviation Warfare, Information Dominance Warfare, Naval Aircrew, Special Warfare, Seabee Warfare, Submarine Warfare or Expeditionary Warfare. Many qualifications are denoted on a sailor's uniform with \n.\n\nThe uniforms of the U.S. Navy have evolved gradually since the first uniform regulations for \n were issued in 1802 on the formation of the Navy Department. The predominant colors of U.S. Navy uniforms are navy blue and white. U.S. Navy uniforms were based on Royal Navy uniforms of the time and have tended to follow that template.\n\n\nNavy officers serve either as a \n or as a \n. Line officers wear an embroidered gold star above their rank of the naval service dress uniform while staff corps officers and commissioned warrant officers wear unique \n insignias that denotes their occupational specialty.\n\n\nWarrant and chief warrant officer ranks are held by technical specialists who direct specific activities essential to the proper operation of the ship, which also require commissioned officer authority.\n Navy warrant officers serve in 30 specialties covering five categories. Warrant officers should not be confused with the \n (LDO) in the Navy. Warrant officers perform duties that are directly related to their previous enlisted service and specialized training. This allows the Navy to capitalize on the experience of warrant officers without having to frequently transition them to other duty assignments for advancement.\n Most Navy warrant officers are accessed from the \n pay grades, E-7 through E-9, analogous to a senior non-commissioned officer in the other services, and must have a minimum 14 years in service.\n\n\nSailors in pay grades E-1 through E-3 are considered to be in apprenticeships.\n They are divided into five definable groups, with colored group rate marks designating the group to which they belong: Seaman, Fireman, Airman, Constructionman, and Hospitalman. \n to \n are \n (NCOs), and are specifically called \n in the Navy.\n Petty Officers perform not only the duties of their specific career field but also serve as leaders to junior enlisted personnel. E-7 to E-9 are still considered Petty Officers, but are considered a separate community within the Navy. They have separate berthing and dining facilities (where feasible), wear separate uniforms, and perform separate duties.\n\nAfter attaining the rate of Master Chief Petty Officer, a service member may choose to further their career by becoming a \n (CMC). A CMC is considered to be the senior-most enlisted service member within a command, and is the special assistant to the \n in all matters pertaining to the health, welfare, job satisfaction, morale, use, advancement and training of the command's enlisted personnel.\n CMCs can be Command level (within a single unit, such as a ship or shore station), Fleet level (squadrons consisting of multiple operational units, headed by a flag officer or commodore), or Force level (consisting of a separate community within the Navy, such as Subsurface, Air, Reserves).\n\n\nCMC insignia are similar to the insignia for Master Chief, except that the rating symbol is replaced by an inverted five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (i.e., MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for Command Master Chief are silver, while stars for Fleet or Force Master Chief are gold. Additionally, CMCs wear a badge, worn on their left breast pocket, denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).\n\n\nInsignia and badges of the United States Navy are military \"badges\" issued by the Department of the Navy to naval service members who achieve certain qualifications and accomplishments while serving on both active and reserve duty in the United States Navy. Most naval aviation insignia are also permitted for wear on uniforms of the \n.\n\nAs described in Chapter 5 of U.S. Navy Uniform Regulations,\n \"badges\" are categorized as \n (usually worn immediately above and below ribbons) and \n (usually worn at breast pocket level).\n Breast insignia are further divided between \n and \n.\n\n\nInsignia come in the form of metal \"pin-on devices\" worn on formal uniforms and embroidered \"tape strips\" worn on work uniforms. For the purpose of this article, the general term \"insignia\" shall be used to describe both, as it is done in Navy Uniform Regulations. The term \"badge\", although used ambiguously in other military branches and in informal speak to describe any pin, patch, or tab, is exclusive to \n and authorized \n according to the language in Navy Uniform Regulations, Chapter 5. Below are just a few of the many badges maintained by the Navy. The rest can be seen in the article cited at the top of this section:\n\nThe size, complexity, and international presence of the United States Navy requires a large number of navy installations to support its operations. While the majority of bases are located inside the United States itself, the Navy maintains a significant number of facilities abroad, either in U.S.-controlled territories or in foreign countries under a \n (SOFA).\n\nThe second largest concentration of installations is at \n, \n, where the navy occupies over 36,000 acres (15,000 ha) of land. Located at Hampton Roads are \n, homeport of the Atlantic Fleet; \n, a \n; \n; and \n as well as a number of Navy and commercial shipyards that service navy vessels. The Aegis Training and Readiness Center is located at the \n in \n. Maryland is home to \n, which houses the Navy's \n. Also located in Maryland is the United States Naval Academy, situated in \n. \n in Newport, Rhode Island is home to many schools and tenant commands, including the \n, \n, and more, and also maintains inactive ships.\n\n\nThere is also a naval base in Charleston, South Carolina. This is home to the Naval Nuclear Power Training Command, under which reside the Nuclear Field \"A\" Schools (for Machinist Mates (Nuclear), Electrician Mates (Nuclear), and Electronics Technicians (Nuclear)), Nuclear Power School (Officer and Enlisted); and one of two Nuclear Power Training Unit 'Prototype' schools. The state of Florida is the location of three major bases, \n, the Navy's fourth largest, in \n; \n, a Master Air Anti-submarine Warfare base; and \n; home of the Naval Education and Training Command, the Naval Air Technical Training Center that provides specialty training for enlisted aviation personnel and is the primary flight training base for Navy and Marine Corps \n and enlisted \n. There is also \n, Florida which is home to the Center for Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Divising (CENEODIVE) and the Navy Diving and Salvage Training Center and \n, Florida, which home to the Naval Air Warfare Center Training Systems Division (NAWCTSD).\n\nThe main U.S. Navy \n on the east coast are located in \n in \n and \n in \n. The \n near \n,\n which repairs naval submarines.\n \n, north of Chicago, Illinois is the home of the Navy's \n for enlisted sailors.\n\nThe \n in Washington, DC is the Navy's oldest shore establishment and serves as a ceremonial and administrative center for the U.S. Navy, home to the Chief of Naval Operations and numerous commands.\n\nThe U.S. Navy's largest complex is \n, California, which covers 1.1 million acres (4,500 km\n) of land, or approximately one-third of the U.S. Navy's total land holdings.\n\n\n, California is the main homeport of the Pacific Fleet, although its headquarters is located in \n, Hawaii. \n is located on the north side of \n, and is home to Headquarters for Naval Air Forces and Naval Air Force Pacific, the bulk of the Pacific Fleet's helicopter squadrons, and part of the West Coast \n fleet. \n is located on the southern end of the Coronado Island and is home to the navy's west coast SEAL teams and special boat units. NAB Coronado is also home to the \n, the primary training center for SEALs.\n\nThe other major collection of naval bases on the west coast is in \n, \n. Among them, \n is one of the newer bases and the navy states that it is its most modern facility.\n\n\n, Nevada serves as the primary training ground for navy strike aircrews and is home to the \n. Master Jet Bases are also located at \n, California, and \n, Washington, while the carrier-based airborne early warning aircraft community and major air test activities are located at \n, California. The naval presence in Hawaii is centered on \n, which hosts the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet and many of its subordinate commands.\n\nGuam, an island strategically located in the Western Pacific Ocean, maintains a sizable U.S. Navy presence, including \n. The westernmost U.S. territory, it contains a natural deepwater harbor capable of harboring aircraft carriers in emergencies.\n Its naval air station was deactivated\n in 1995 and its flight activities transferred to nearby \n.\n\n in the Caribbean formerly housed \n, which was shut down in 2004 shortly after the controversial closure of the live ordnance training area on nearby \n.\n\n\nThe largest overseas base is the \n, Japan, which serves as the home port for the navy's largest forward-deployed fleet and is a significant base of operations in the Western Pacific.\n\n\nEuropean operations revolve around facilities in Italy (\n and \n) with \n as the homeport for the Sixth Fleet and Command Naval Region Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia (CNREURAFSWA), and additional facilities in nearby \n. There is also \n in Spain and \n in Greece.\n\nIn the Middle East, naval facilities are located almost exclusively in countries bordering the \n, with \n serving as the headquarters of \n and \n.\n\n in Cuba is the oldest overseas facility and has become known in recent years as the location of a \n for suspected \n operatives.\n\n\nAs of 2018\n, the navy operates over 460 ships (including vessels operated by the \n), 3,650+ aircraft, 50,000 non-combat vehicles and owns 75,200 buildings on 3,300,000 acres (13,000 km\n).\n\nThe names of commissioned ships of the U.S. Navy are prefixed with the letters \"USS\", designating \"United States Ship\".\n Non-commissioned, civilian-manned vessels of the navy have names that begin with \"USNS\", standing for \"United States Naval Ship\". The names of ships are officially selected by the secretary of the navy, often to honor important people or places.\n Additionally, each ship is given a letter-based \n (for example, CVN or DDG) to indicate the vessel's type and number. All ships in the navy inventory are placed in the \n, which is part of \"the Navy List\" (required by article 29 of the \n).\n The register tracks data such as the current status of a ship, the date of its commissioning, and the date of its decommissioning. Vessels that are removed from the register prior to disposal are said to be \n from the register. The navy also maintains a \n of inactive vessels that are maintained for reactivation in times of need.\n\nThe U.S. Navy was one of the first to install \n.\n Today, \n powers all active U.S. aircraft carriers and \n.\n\nIn early 2010, the U.S. Navy had identified a need for 313 combat ships but could only afford 232 to 243 ships.\n In March 2014, the Navy started counting self-deployable support ships such as minesweepers, surveillance craft, and tugs in the \"battle fleet\" to reach a count of 272 as of October 2016,\n and it includes ships that have been put in \"shrink wrap\".\n The number of ships generally ranged between 270 and 300 throughout the late 2010s.\n As of February 2022, the Navy has 296 battle force ships, however analyses state the Navy needs a fleet of more than 500 to meet its commitments.\n\n\n act as \n for \n. They are the largest vessels in the Navy fleet and all are nuclear-powered.\n An aircraft carrier is typically deployed along with a host of additional vessels, forming a \n. The supporting ships, which usually include three or four \n-equipped cruisers and destroyers, a frigate, and two attack submarines, are tasked with protecting the carrier from air, missile, sea, and undersea threats as well as providing additional strike capabilities themselves. Ready logistics support for the group is provided by a combined ammunition, oiler, and supply ship. Modern carriers are \n after American admirals and politicians, usually presidents.\n\n\nThe Navy has a statutory requirement for a minimum of 11 aircraft carriers.\n All 11 carriers are currently active, ten \n and one \n.\n\n\n\nAircraft Carriers have the ability to house 5,000 people. This is the size of a small town floating in the ocean. Aircraft carriers also have up to 90 aircraft on the ship at one time. \n\n are the centerpieces of US amphibious warfare and fulfill the same power projection role as aircraft carriers except that their striking force centers on land forces instead of aircraft. They deliver, command, coordinate, and fully support all elements of a 2,200-strong \n in an amphibious assault using both air and amphibious vehicles. Resembling small aircraft carriers, amphibious assault ships are capable of \n, \n, \n, tiltrotor, and rotary wing aircraft operations. They also contain a \n to support the use of \n (LCAC) and other amphibious assault watercraft. Recently, amphibious assault ships have begun to be deployed as the core of an \n, which usually consists of an additional \n and \n for amphibious warfare and an Aegis-equipped cruiser and destroyer, frigate, and attack submarine for group defense. Amphibious assault ships are typically named after World War II aircraft carriers.\n\n are warships that embark, transport, and land Marines, supplies, and equipment in a supporting role during amphibious warfare missions. With a landing platform, amphibious transport docks also have the capability to serve as secondary aviation support for an expeditionary group. All amphibious transport docks can operate helicopters, LCACs, and other conventional amphibious vehicles while the newer \n class of ships has been explicitly designed to operate all three elements of the Marines' \"mobility triad\": \n (EFVs), the \n tiltrotor aircraft, and LCACs. Amphibious transport docks are typically named after U.S. cities.\n\nThe dock landing ship is a medium amphibious transport that is designed specifically to support and operate LCACs, though it is able to operate other amphibious assault vehicles in the United States inventory as well. Dock landing ships are normally deployed as a component of an expeditionary strike group's amphibious assault contingent, operating as a secondary launch platform for LCACs. All dock landing ships are named after cities or important places in U.S. and U.S. Naval history.\n\n\nThe Navy operates 32 amphibious warfare ships, eight \n and two \n amphibious assault ships, four \n and six \n dock landing ships, and 12 \n amphibious transport dock ships.\n\n are large surface combat vessels that conduct anti-air/anti-missile warfare, surface warfare, anti-submarine warfare, and strike operations independently or as members of a larger task force. Modern guided missile cruisers were developed out of a need to counter the \n threat facing the United States Navy. This led to the development of the \n phased array radar and the \n missile with the Aegis combat system coordinating the two. \n cruisers were the first to be equipped with Aegis and were put to use primarily as anti-air and anti-missile defense in a battle force protection role. Later developments of \n and the \n gave cruisers additional long-range land and sea strike capability, making them capable of both offensive and defensive battle operations. The \n class is the only active class of cruiser. All cruisers in this class are named after battles.\n\n\n are multi-mission medium surface ships capable of sustained performance in anti-air, anti-submarine, anti-ship, and offensive strike operations. Like cruisers, guided missile destroyers are primarily focused on surface strikes using Tomahawk missiles and fleet defense through Aegis and the Standard missile. Destroyers additionally specialize in anti-submarine warfare and are equipped with \n and \n helicopters to deal with underwater threats. When deployed with a carrier strike group or expeditionary strike group, destroyers and their fellow Aegis-equipped cruisers are primarily tasked with defending the fleet while providing secondary strike capabilities. With very few exceptions, destroyers are named after U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard heroes.\n\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has 75 destroyers, 73 \n destroyers and two \n stealth destroyers, with a third (the \n) expected to enter service sometime in 2024.\n\n\nModern U.S. \n mainly perform anti-submarine warfare for carrier and expeditionary strike groups and provide armed escort for supply convoys and merchant shipping. They are designed to protect friendly ships against hostile submarines in low to medium threat environments, using torpedoes and LAMPS helicopters. Independently, frigates are able to conduct counterdrug missions and other maritime interception operations. As in the case of destroyers, frigates are named after U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard heroes.\n\nIn late 2015, the U.S. Navy retired its most recent class of traditional frigates in favor of the littoral combat ship (LCS), relatively small vessels designed for near-shore operations that was expected to assume many of the duties the frigate had with the fleet. The LCS was \"envisioned to be a networked, agile, stealthy surface combatant capable of defeating \n and \n in the \n\",\n although their ability to perform these missions in practice has been called into question.\n The Navy has announced it plans to reduce procurement of the LCS and retire early examples of the type.\n\nIn the future, the Navy plans to purchase up to 20 of the \n, based on the \n, already in service with European navies.\n\nThe U.S. Navy currently has 23 littoral combat ships, eight \n and 15 \n ships.\n\nA special case is the \n, commissioned in 1797 as one of the original six frigates of the United States Navy and which remains in commission at the Charlestown Navy Yard in Boston. She occasionally sails for commemorative events such as \n.\n\n are a combination of \n, a naval vessel that actively detects and destroys individual \n, and \n, which clear mined areas as a whole, without prior detection of the mines. MCM vessels have mostly legacy names of previous US Navy ships, especially World War II-era minesweepers.\n\nThe Navy operates eight \n, with four expected to be retired in 2024.\n\nThe U.S. Navy operates three types of submarines: \n, \n and \n. All current and planned U.S. Navy submarines are nuclear-powered, as nuclear propulsion allows for a combination of stealth and long-duration, high-speed, sustained underwater movement.\n\nAttack submarines typically operate as part of a \n, while \n generally operate independently and carry larger quantities of cruise missiles. Both types have several tactical missions, including sinking ships and other subs, launching \n, gathering intelligence, and assisting in special operations. Ballistic missile submarines operate independently with only one mission: to carry and, if called upon, to launch the \n.\n\nThe Navy operates 69 submarines, 29 \n attack submarines (with two more in reserve), 18 \n submarines with 14 configured as ballistic missile submarines and four configured as guided missile submarines, three \n attack submarines, and 19 \n attack submarines.\n\nCarrier-based aircraft are able to strike air, sea, and land targets far from a carrier strike group while protecting friendly forces from enemy aircraft, ships, and submarines. In peacetime, aircraft's ability to project the threat of sustained attack from a mobile platform on the seas gives United States leaders significant diplomatic and crisis-management options. Aircraft additionally provide logistics support to maintain the navy's readiness and, through helicopters, supply platforms with which to conduct \n, \n, anti-submarine warfare (ASW), and anti-surface warfare, including the U.S. Navy's premier Maritime Strike and only organic ASW aircraft, the venerable Sikorsky MH-60R operated by \n.\n\nThe U.S. Navy began to research the use of aircraft at sea in the 1910s, with Lieutenant Theodore G. \"Spuds\" Ellyson becoming the first naval aviator on 28 January 1911, and commissioned its first aircraft carrier, \n, in 1922.\n United States naval aviation fully came of age in World War II, when it became clear following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the Battle of Midway that aircraft carriers and the planes that they carried had replaced the battleship as the greatest weapon on the seas. Leading navy aircraft in World War II included the \n, the \n, the Chance \n, the \n, and the \n. Navy aircraft also played a significant role in conflicts during the following Cold War years, with the \n and the \n becoming military icons of the era. The navy's current primary fighter-attack airplane is the multi-mission \n. The \n entered service in 2019.\n The Navy is also looking to eventually replace its F/A-18E/F Super Hornets with the \n program.\n\nThe Aircraft Investment Plan sees naval aviation growing from 30 percent of current aviation forces to half of all procurement funding over the next three decades.\n\n\nCurrent U.S. Navy shipboard weapons systems are almost entirely focused on missiles, both as a weapon and as a threat. In an offensive role, missiles are intended to strike targets at long distances with accuracy and precision. Because they are unmanned weapons, missiles allow for attacks on heavily defended targets without risk to human pilots. Land strikes are the domain of the BGM-109 Tomahawk, which was first deployed in the 1980s and is continually being updated to increase its capabilities. For anti-ship strikes, the navy's dedicated missile is the \n. To defend against enemy missile attack, the navy operates a number of systems that are all coordinated by the Aegis combat system. Medium-long range defense is provided by the Standard Missile 2, which has been deployed since the 1980s. The Standard missile doubles as the primary shipboard anti-aircraft weapon and is undergoing development for use in theater ballistic missile defense. Short range defense against missiles is provided by the \n and the more recently developed \n. In addition to missiles, the navy employs \n, \n, and \n \n and various types of naval mines.\n\nNaval fixed-wing aircraft employ much of the same weapons as the \n for both air-to-air and air-to-surface combat. Air engagements are handled by the heat-seeking \n and the radar guided \n missiles along with the \n cannon for close range dogfighting. For surface strikes, navy aircraft use a combination of missiles, smart bombs, and dumb bombs. On the list of available missiles are the \n, \n and \n. Smart bombs include the GPS-guided \n and the laser-guided \n series. Unguided munitions such as dumb bombs and \n make up the rest of the weapons deployed by fixed-wing aircraft.\n\nRotary aircraft weapons are focused on anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and light to medium surface engagements. To combat submarines, helicopters use Mark 46 and Mark 50 torpedoes. Against small watercraft, they use \n and \n air to surface missiles. Helicopters also employ various types of mounted anti-personnel machine guns, including the \n, \n, \n/A, and \n.\n\nNuclear weapons in the U.S. Navy arsenal are deployed through ballistic missile submarines and aircraft. The \n-class submarine carries the latest iteration of the \n, a three-stage, \n (SLBM) with \n capability; the current Trident II (D5) version is expected to be in service past 2020.\n The navy's other nuclear weapon is the air-deployed \n. The B61 is a thermonuclear device that can be dropped by strike aircraft such as the F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet at high speed from a large range of altitudes. It can be released through free-fall or parachute and can be set to detonate in the air or on the ground.\n\nThe current \n of the United States is the \n, a small blue flag emblazoned with the stars of the 50 states. The Union Jack was not flown for the duration of the War on Terror, during which Secretary of the Navy \n directed all U.S. naval ships to fly the \n. While Secretary England directed the change on 31 May 2002, many ships chose to shift colors later that year in remembrance of the first anniversary of the \n. The Union Jack, however, remained in use with vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard and \n. A jack of similar design to the Union Jack was used in 1794, with 13 stars arranged in a 3–2–3–2–3 pattern. When a ship is moored or anchored, the jack is flown from the \n of the ship while the ensign is flown from the \n. When underway, the ensign is raised on the mainmast. Before the decision for all ships to fly the First Navy Jack, it was flown only on the oldest ship in the active American fleet, which is currently \n. U.S. Navy ships and craft returned to flying the Union Jack effective 4 June 2019. The date for reintroduction of the jack commemorates the Battle of Midway, which began on 4 June 1942.\n\n\nMany past and present United States historical figures have served in the U.S. Navy.\n\nNotable officers include: \n\nThe first American President who served in the U.S. Navy was \n (who commanded the famous \n in World War II); he was then followed by \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n\nSome notable former members of the Navy include \n, \n, \n, and \n, along with \n, \n of Florida, and \n, Governor of \n.\n\nNotable former members of the U.S. Navy include; astronauts (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n), entertainers (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n), authors (\n, \n, \n, \n), musicians, (\n, \n, \n, \n), professional athletes (\n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n), business people (\n, \n, \n), and computer scientists (\n).\n"},

She earned her \n in 1939, when it was unusual for women to be pilots.\n\nIn 1943, Olsen joined the newly formed WASPs as a \n employee.  After training in \n, she was assigned to the Sixth Ferrying Group in \n, where she worked \n new aircraft from the factories where they were built to U.S. airbases. She flew more than 20 types of military airplanes, including high-performance fighters such as the \n and the twin-engine \n, which she favored over larger aircraft such as bombers; she was particularly fond of the P-51.\n\nAfter the war, Olsen retired from flying and moved to the state of \n, where she married, raised a family, and lived for the rest of her life.  In 2009, she was awarded the \n honoring her service during the war.  Olsen died in 2019 aged 103.\n\nDorothy Eleanor Olsen was born in \n, near \n, on July 10, 1916, to Ralph and Frances (Zimmering) Kocher, and grew up on the family's small farm.\n  At the age of eight, she decided she wanted to fly airplanes after reading \n, \n's biography of \n flying ace \n.  Olsen's introduction to flight was when she took a \n ride at a state fair, which inspired her to take flying lessons;\n the cost of the flight reportedly exhausted her entire savings.\n  In 2011, she told the \n:\n\n\nFrom the time I was a little girl and jumped from the top of our barn in Woodburn, Oregon, and into the hay until the time I was flying night missions as a Woman Airforce Service Pilot (WASP) over moon-lit Texas during World War II, I just loved to fly.\nAfter leaving high school, Olsen worked briefly as a dance instructor.\n She earned her \n in 1939,\n taking her \n in a 40 hp (30 kW) \n.  Reportedly one of only three women in the Portland area to have a private pilot's license,\n Olsen flew with the Woodburn Flying Club\n (she recalled being the only woman among nineteen men),\n and with the \n in \n and \n.\n\n\nIn September 1942, the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron was formed, led by \n.  The squadron recruited women who already held \n with an average of 1,100 hours flying experience, to \n military aircraft without the need for any additional training.  In the same month, the \n was created under the leadership of \n.  This group took less experienced women pilots and provided them with additional training to fly military aircraft, comparable to the \n cadet curriculum.  In the summer of 1943,\n these two units were merged to form the \n (WASPs).  WASPs took non-combat flying jobs as civil service employees, including flight instruction, towing gliders and gunnery practice targets, performing engineering test flights, and aircraft ferrying.\n\n\nOlsen joined the WASPs in 1943.  A small woman, 5 feet (1.52 m) tall, Olsen embarked on a weight-gaining regimen based on bananas and malted milk to make the 100-pound (45 kg) required minimum.\n There were more than 25,000 applicants to the program, of whom fewer than 1,900\n were accepted and 1,074 graduated; Olsen was one of 152 students in class 43-4.  Her training began in February 1943, at Houston Municipal Field (renamed \n in 1967) where half of her class was stationed; the other half reported to \n in \n.\n  Applicants had to pay their own travel expenses to get to the training camps, as well covering lodging expenses and purchasing dress uniforms.\n  The initial training was in the \n, progressing to the \n, the \n, and finally to the twin-engine \n.\n\n\nOlsen initially hated her training, but she stayed with the program to avoid the embarrassment of dropping out.\n In a 2010 interview, she recollected crowded housing, insects, and poor weather that made the conditions \"pretty primitive\".\n  She encountered difficulties when her fiancé died of spinal meningitis; taking time off to attend his funeral put her behind the rest of her class. Despite being sick with a cold on her return, she passed a checkride that included \n, allowing her to stay with her class although she struggled to catch up.\n  She graduated on August 7, 1943,\n and was assigned to the Sixth Ferrying Group in \n.\n  She later said:\n\n\nI was so lucky, 'cause I wouldn't have gotten Long Beach if I'd been held back.  Long Beach was the base that was the key to the fighters.  I would have been heartbroken if I hadn't gotten Long Beach.\nOlsen credited Jacqueline Cochran, the director of the WASP, with providing an opportunity to keep women pilots flying during \n.\n  Olsen flew 61 missions for the \n, delivering brand new planes with less than a half hour of flight time on them from the factory.  She was one of only 12 women certified for night flight.\n  A typical assignment for Olsen was to ferry a \n or \n from Long Beach to \n, then get a military transport flight to \n, where she would pick up a \n for delivery to \n, and then return to Long Beach for another trip.\n  These were all single-seat fighters, with the P-38 being twin engine, the P-51 and P-63 single engine.\n\n\nOlsen took a pair of good shoes with her on ferry flights so she could go on dancing dates with men at her destination before having to take off on her next flight.\n  She often left her name and address in the cockpits of planes she had ferried, to be found later by the combat pilots,\n a practice shared by other WASPs.\n  Two such combat pilots sent replies.  One, a lieutenant, wrote \"I thought I'd write a few lines to let you know that despite the fact that a woman once flew it, the ship performs perfectly and is apparently without flaws of any kind\".\n  WASPs were not considered military personnel; Olsen is listed in the Sixth Ferrying Group  yearbook with the title of \"Civilian Pilot\".\n  When the WASP program ended in 1944, the pilots were discharged at their home bases but with no transportation allowance to get back home.\n  WASPs were retroactively granted veteran status as part of the GI Bill Improvement Act of 1977.\n\n\nAccording to Olsen, she flew more than 20 different models of military aircraft, both Army and Navy types.\n Her favorite was the P-51.\n  Debbie Jennings, a historian with the \n,\n said Olsen disliked flying bombers because in the single-seat fighters, \"she was by herself and could do whatever she wanted\". Jennings mentioned that Olsen enjoyed scaring farmers on their tractors by flying close to them and \"would do the same at railroad stations just because\".\n For these actions, she was reprimanded by her superiors.  According to her son, \"She felt bombers were like driving buses\".\n  Her daughter noted that Olsen felt the P-38 was \"an old woman's plane\", which \"anybody could fly\", but a pilot had to \"stay on top of\" the P-51.\n\n\nAfter the war, Kocher married Harold W. Olsen of the \n Police Department, and they moved to \n. The couple had a daughter, Julie (Stranburg), and a son, Kim;\n after raising them, she ran antique shops.\n  Nerve damage from a dental procedure left her deaf for many years, but at the age of 80 she received \n that restored her hearing.\n\n\nOlsen never flew commercially after the war, and never flew at all after having children.  She is quoted as saying, \"Why would I want to fly a \n when I've flown a P-51?\"\n  In 2009, Olsen (along with her fellow WASPs) was awarded the \n to commemorate her service.\n  In 2015, she was honored with a \n of Seattle's \n by vintage aircraft for her 99th birthday.\n In 2016, Olsen celebrated her 100th birthday at \n.

As the Revolutionary War progressed, \n aid, resources, and military thinking helped shape the new army. A number of European soldiers came on their own to help, such as \n, who taught \n tactics and organizational skills.\n\nThe Army fought numerous pitched battles, and sometimes used \n and \n in the South in 1780 and 1781; under Major General \n, it hit where the British were weakest to wear down their forces. Washington led victories against the British at \n and \n, but lost a series of battles in the \n in 1776 and the \n in 1777. With a decisive victory at \n and the help of the French, the Continental Army prevailed against the British.\n\nAfter the war, the Continental Army was quickly given land certificates and disbanded in a reflection of the \n distrust of standing armies. \n militias became the new nation's sole ground army, except \n to guard the \n and one battery of \n guarding \n's arsenal. However, because of continuing conflict with \n, it was soon considered necessary to field a trained standing army. The \n was at first very small and after General \n at the Battle of the Wabash,\n where more than 800 soldiers were killed, the Regular Army was reorganized as the \n, established in 1791 and renamed the United States Army in 1796.\n\nIn 1798, during the \n with France, the \n established a three-year \"\n\" of 10,000 men, consisting of twelve \n of \n and six troops of light \n.

Both \"armies\" existed only on paper, but equipment for 3,000 men and horses was procured and stored.\n\n\nThe \n, the second and last war between the United States and Great Britain, had mixed results.  The U.S. Army did not conquer Canada but it did destroy Native American resistance to expansion in the \n and it validated its independence by stopping two major British invasions in 1814 and 1815. After \n in 1813, the U.S. Army seized parts of western Upper Canada, \n and \n, which caused his \n to collapse. Following U.S. victories in the Canadian province of Upper Canada, British troops who had dubbed the U.S. Army \"Regulars, by God!\", were able to capture and \n, which was defended by militia, in 1814. The regular army, however, proved they were professional and capable of defeating the British army during the \n and \n, prompting British agreement on the previously rejected terms of a \n antebellum.\n Two weeks after a treaty was signed (but not ratified), \n defeated the British in the \n and \n with an army dominated by militia and volunteers, and became a national hero. U.S. troops and sailors \n, \n and \n in the final engagements of the war. Per the treaty, both sides (the United States and Great Britain) returned to the geographical status quo. Both navies kept the warships they had seized during the conflict.\n\nThe army's major campaign against the Indians was fought in \n against \n. It took long wars (1818–1858) to finally defeat the Seminoles and move them to Oklahoma. The usual strategy in Indian wars was to seize control of the Indians' winter food supply, but that was no use in Florida where there was no winter. The second strategy was to form alliances with other Indian tribes, but that too was useless because the Seminoles had destroyed all the other Indians when they entered Florida in the late eighteenth century.\n\n\nThe U.S. Army fought and won the \n (1846–1848), which was a defining event for both countries.\n The U.S. victory resulted in acquisition of territory that eventually became all or parts of the states of \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\n\nThe \n was the costliest war for the U.S. in terms of casualties. After most \n, located in the southern U.S., formed the \n, the \n, led by former U.S. Army officers, mobilized a large fraction of Southern white manpower. Forces of the United States (the \"Union\" or \"the North\") formed the \n, consisting of a small body of regular army units and a large body of volunteer units raised from every state, north and south, except \n.\n\n\nFor the first two years, Confederate forces did well in set battles but lost control of the border states.\n The Confederates had the advantage of defending a large territory in an area where disease caused twice as many deaths as combat. The Union pursued a strategy of seizing the coastline, blockading the ports, and taking control of the river systems. By 1863, the Confederacy was being strangled. Its eastern armies fought well, but the western armies were defeated one after another until the Union forces captured New Orleans in 1862 along with the Tennessee River.  In the \n of 1862–1863, General \n seized the \n and cut off the Southwest.  Grant took command of Union forces in 1864 and after a series of battles with very heavy casualties, he had General \n under siege in Richmond as General \n captured Atlanta and \n and \n.  The Confederate capital was abandoned in April 1865 and Lee subsequently surrendered his army at Appomattox Court House. All other Confederate armies surrendered within a few months.\n\nThe war remains the deadliest conflict in U.S. history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 men on both sides. Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white males aged 13 to 43 died in the war, including 6.4% in \n and 18% in \n.\n\n\nFollowing the Civil War, the U.S. Army had the mission of containing western tribes of Native Americans on the \n. They set up many forts, and engaged in the last of the \n. U.S. Army troops also occupied several Southern states during the \n to protect \n.\n\nThe key battles of the \n of 1898 were fought by the Navy. Using mostly \n, the U.S. forces defeated \n in land campaigns in \n and played the central role in the \n.\n\nStarting in 1910, the army began acquiring \n.\n In 1910, during the \n, the army was deployed to U.S. towns near the border to ensure the safety of lives and property. In 1916, \n, a major rebel leader, attacked \n, prompting a \n until 7 February 1917. They fought the rebels and the Mexican federal troops until 1918.\n\nThe \n as an \"Associated Power\" in 1917 on the side of \n, \n, \n, \n and the other \n. U.S. troops were sent to the \n and were involved in the last offensives that ended the war. With the armistice in November 1918, the army once again decreased its forces.\n\nIn 1939, estimates of the Army's strength ranged between 174,000 and 200,000 soldiers, smaller than that of \n's, which ranked it 17th or 19th in the world in size. General \n became Army chief of staff in September 1939 and set about expanding and modernizing the Army in preparation for war.\n\n\nThe United States joined \n in December 1941 after the \n \n. Some 11 million Americans were to serve in various Army operations.\n On the \n, U.S. Army troops formed a significant portion of the forces that landed in French North Africa and \n and then \n and later \n. In the June 1944 \n and in the subsequent \n and defeat of \n, millions of U.S. Army troops played a central role. In 1947, the number of soldiers in the US Army had decreased from eight million in 1945 to 684,000 soldiers and the total number of active divisions had dropped from 89 to 12. The leaders of the Army saw this demobilization as a success.\n\nIn the \n, U.S. Army soldiers participated alongside the \n in capturing the \n from Japanese control. Following the \n surrenders in May (Germany) and August (Japan) of 1945, army troops were deployed to Japan and Germany to occupy the two defeated nations. Two years after World War II, the \n separated from the army to become the \n in September 1947. In 1948, the army was \n by \n of President \n.\n\nThe end of World War II set the stage for the East–West confrontation known as the \n. With the outbreak of the \n, concerns over the defense of Western Europe rose. Two corps, \n and \n, were reactivated under \n in 1950 and U.S. strength in Europe rose from one division to four. Hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops remained stationed in West Germany, with others in \n, the \n and the \n, until the 1990s in anticipation of a possible \n attack.\n\n\nDuring the Cold War, U.S. troops and their allies fought \n forces in Korea and \n. The Korean War began in June 1950, when the Soviets walked out of a UN Security Council meeting, removing their possible veto. Under a \n umbrella, hundreds of thousands of U.S. troops fought to prevent the takeover of \n by \n and later to invade the northern nation. After repeated advances and retreats by both sides and the Chinese \n's entry into the war, the \n returned the peninsula to the status quo in July 1953.\n\nThe \n is often regarded as a low point for the U.S. Army due to the use of \n, the unpopularity of the war with the U.S. public and frustrating restrictions placed on the military by U.S. political leaders. While U.S. forces had been stationed in \n since 1959, in intelligence and advising/training roles, they were not deployed in large numbers until 1965, after the \n. U.S. forces effectively established and maintained control of the \"traditional\" battlefield, but they struggled to counter the \n hit and run tactics of the communist \n and the \n.\n\n\nDuring the 1960s, the Department of Defense continued to scrutinize the reserve forces and to question the number of divisions and brigades as well as the redundancy of maintaining two reserve components, the \n and the \n.\n In 1967, Secretary of Defense \n decided that 15 combat divisions in the Army National Guard were unnecessary and cut the number to eight divisions (one mechanized infantry, two armored, and five infantry), but increased the number of brigades from seven to 18 (one airborne, one armored, two mechanized infantry and 14 infantry). The loss of the divisions did not sit well with the states. Their objections included the inadequate maneuver element mix for those that remained and the end to the practice of rotating divisional commands among the states that supported them. Under the proposal, the remaining division commanders were to reside in the state of the division base. However, no reduction in total Army National Guard strength was to take place, which convinced the governors to accept the plan. The states reorganized their forces accordingly between 1 December 1967 and 1 May 1968.\n\nThe Total Force Policy was adopted by Chief of Staff of the Army General \n in the aftermath of the Vietnam War and involved treating the three components of the army – the \n, the \n and the \n as a single force.\n General Abrams' intertwining of the three components of the army effectively made extended operations impossible without the involvement of both the Army National Guard and Army Reserve in a predominantly combat support role.\n  The army converted to an all-volunteer force with greater emphasis on training to specific performance standards driven by the reforms of General \n, the first commander of \n. Following the Camp David Accords that was signed by Egypt, Israel that was brokered by president \n in 1978, as part of the agreement, both the United States and \n agreed that there would be a joint military training led by both countries that would usually take place every 2 years, that exercise is known as \n.\n\nThe 1980s was mostly a decade of reorganization. The \n of 1986 created \n bringing the army together with the other four \n under unified, geographically organized command structures. The army also played a role in the invasions of \n in 1983 (\n) and \n in 1989 (\n).\n\nBy 1989 \n and the Cold War was coming to a close. Army leadership reacted by starting to plan for a reduction in strength. By November 1989 Pentagon briefers were laying out plans to reduce army end strength by 23%, from 750,000 to 580,000.\n A number of incentives such as early retirement were used.\n\nIn 1990, \n \n its smaller neighbor, \n, and U.S. land forces quickly deployed to assure the protection of \n. In January 1991 \n commenced, a U.S.-led coalition which deployed over 500,000 troops, the bulk of them from U.S. Army formations, to \n. The campaign ended in total victory, as Western coalition forces routed the \n. Some of the largest tank battles in history were fought during the Gulf war. The \n, \n and the \n were tank battles of historical significance.\n\n\nAfter Operation Desert Storm, the army did not see major combat operations for the remainder of the 1990s but did participate in a number of peacekeeping activities. In 1990 the Department of Defense issued guidance for \"rebalancing\" after a review of the Total Force Policy,\n but in 2004, \n scholars concluded the guidance would reverse the Total Force Policy which is an \"essential ingredient to the successful application of military force\".\n\n\nOn 11 September 2001, 53 Army civilians (47 employees and six contractors) and 22 soldiers were among the 125 victims killed in \n in a \n when \n commandeered by five \n \n slammed into the western side of the building, as part of the \n.\n In response to the 11 September attacks and as part of the \n, U.S. and \n forces \n in October 2001, displacing the \n government. The U.S. Army also led the combined U.S. and allied \n in 2003; it served as the primary source for ground forces with its ability to sustain short and long-term deployment operations. In the following years, the mission changed from conflict between regular militaries to \n, resulting in the deaths of more than 4,000 U.S. service members (as of March 2008) and injuries to thousands more.\n 23,813 insurgents were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2011.\n\n\nUntil 2009, the army's chief modernization plan, its most ambitious since World War II,\n was the \n program. In 2009, many systems were canceled, and the remaining were swept into the \n.\n By 2017, the Brigade Modernization project was completed and its headquarters, the Brigade Modernization Command, was renamed the Joint Modernization Command, or JMC.\n In response to \n, Army plans were to shrink to 1940 levels,\n although actual Active-Army end-strengths were projected to fall to some 450,000 troops by the end of FY2017.\n From 2016 to 2017, the Army retired hundreds of \n observation helicopters,\n while retaining its Apache gunships.\n The 2015 expenditure for Army research, development and acquisition changed from $32 billion projected in 2012 for FY15 to $21 billion for FY15 expected in 2014.\n\n\nBy 2017, a task force was formed to address Army modernization,\n which triggered shifts of units: \n, and \n, from within \n (AMC), and \n (TRADOC), respectively, to a new Army Command (ACOM) in 2018.\n The \n (AFC), is a peer of FORSCOM, TRADOC, and AMC, the other ACOMs.\n AFC's mission is modernization reform: to design hardware, as well as to work within the acquisition process which defines materiel for AMC. TRADOC's mission is to define the architecture and organization of the Army, and to train and supply soldiers to FORSCOM.\n \n are Futures Command's vehicle for sustainable \n for the future.\n In order to support the Army's modernization priorities, its FY2020 budget allocated $30 billion for the top six modernization priorities over the next five years.\n The $30 billion came from $8 billion in cost avoidance and $22 billion in terminations.\n\n\nThe task of organizing the U.S. Army commenced in 1775.\n In the first one hundred years of its existence, the United States Army was maintained as a small peacetime force to man permanent \n and perform other non-wartime duties such as \n and construction works. During times of war, the U.S. Army was augmented by the much larger \n which were raised independently by various state governments. States also maintained full-time \n which could also be called into the service of the army.\n\nBy the twentieth century, the U.S. Army had mobilized the U.S. Volunteers on four occasions during each of the major wars of the nineteenth century. During World War I, the \"\n\" was organized to fight the conflict, replacing the concept of U.S. Volunteers.\n It was demobilized at the end of World War I, and was replaced by the Regular Army, the Organized Reserve Corps and the state militias. In the 1920s and 1930s, the \"career\" soldiers were known as the \"\n\" with the \"Enlisted Reserve Corps\" and \"Officer Reserve Corps\" augmented to fill vacancies when needed.\n\n\nIn 1941, the \"\n\" was founded to fight World War II. The Regular Army, Army of the United States, the National Guard and Officer/Enlisted Reserve Corps (ORC and ERC) existed simultaneously. After World War II, the ORC and ERC were combined into the \n. The Army of the United States was re-established for the \n and \n and was demobilized upon the suspension of the \n.\n\n\nCurrently, the Army is divided into the \n, the Army Reserve and the \n.\n  Some states further maintain \n, as a type of reserve to the National Guard, while all states maintain regulations for \n.\n State militias are both \"organized\", meaning that they are armed forces usually part of the state defense forces, or \"unorganized\" simply meaning that all able-bodied males may be eligible to be called into military service.\n\nThe U.S. Army is also divided into \n.  Branches include officers, warrant officers, and enlisted Soldiers while functional areas consist of officers who are reclassified from their former branch into a functional area. However, officers continue to wear the \n of their former branch in most cases, as functional areas do not generally have discrete insignia. Some branches, such as \n, operate similarly to functional areas in that individuals may not join their ranks until having served in another Army branch. Careers in the Army can extend into cross-functional areas for officer,\n warrant officer, enlisted, and civilian personnel.\n\nBefore 1933, members of the Army National Guard were considered state militia until they were mobilized into the U.S. Army, typically on the onset of war. Since the 1933 amendment to the \n, all Army National Guard soldiers have held dual status. They serve as National Guardsmen under the authority of the governor of their state or territory and as reserve members of the U.S. Army under the authority of the president, in the Army National Guard of the United States.\n\nSince the adoption of the total force policy, in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, reserve component soldiers have taken a more active role in U.S. military operations. For example, Reserve and Guard units took part in the \n, peacekeeping in \n, Afghanistan, and the \n.\n\n \n (HQDA):\n\nSee \n for a detailed treatment of the \n, \n, \n and the \n of the Army.\n\nThe U.S. Army is made up of three components: the active component, the Regular Army; and two reserve components, the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve. Both reserve components are primarily composed of part-time soldiers who train once a month – known as \n or unit training assemblies (UTAs) – and conduct two to three weeks of annual training each year. Both the Regular Army and the Army Reserve are organized under \n, while the National Guard is organized under \n. While the Army National Guard is organized, trained and equipped as a component of the U.S. Army, when it is not in federal service it is under the command of individual state and territorial governors. However, the District of Columbia National Guard reports to the U.S. president, not the district's mayor, even when not federalized. Any or all of the \n can be federalized by presidential order and against the governor's wishes.\n\n\nThe U.S. Army is led by a civilian \n, who has the statutory authority to conduct all the affairs of the army under the authority, direction and control of the \n.\n The \n, who is the highest-ranked military officer in the army, serves as the principal military adviser and executive agent for the secretary of the Army, i.e., its service chief; and as a member of the \n, a body composed of the service chiefs from each of the four military services belonging to the Department of Defense who advise the \n, the secretary of defense and the \n on operational military matters, under the guidance of the \n and \n.\n In 1986, the \n mandated that operational control of the services follows a chain of command from the president to the secretary of defense directly to the \n, who have control of all armed forces units in their geographic or function area of responsibility, thus the secretaries of the military departments (and their respective service chiefs underneath them) only have the responsibility to organize, train and equip their service components. The army provides trained forces to the combatant commanders for use as directed by the secretary of defense.\n\n\nBy 2013, the army shifted to six geographical commands that align with the six geographical unified combatant commands (CCMD):\n\nThe army also transformed its base unit from \n to \n. Division lineage will be retained, but the divisional headquarters will be able to command any brigade, not just brigades that carry their divisional lineage. The central part of this plan is that each brigade will be modular, i.e., all brigades of the same type will be exactly the same and thus any brigade can be commanded by any division. As specified before the 2013 end-strength re-definitions, the three major types of brigade combat teams are:\n\nIn addition, there are combat support and service support modular brigades. Combat support brigades include \n (CAB) brigades, which will come in heavy and light varieties, \n (artillery) brigades (now transforms to division artillery) and \n. \n brigades include \n brigades and come in several varieties and serve the standard support role in an army.\n\nThe U.S. Army's conventional combat capability currently consists of 11 active divisions and 1 deployable division headquarters (7th Infantry Division) as well as several independent maneuver units.\n\nFrom 2013 through 2017, the Army sustained organizational and end-strength reductions after several years of \n. In June 2013, the Army announced plans to downsize to 32 active brigade combat teams by 2015 to match a reduction in active-duty strength to 490,000 soldiers. Army chief of staff Raymond Odierno projected that the Army was to shrink to \"450,000 in the active component, 335,000 in the National Guard and 195,000 in U.S. Army Reserve\" by 2018.\n However, this plan was scrapped by the incoming Trump administration, with subsequent plans to expand the Army by 16,000 soldiers to a total of 476,000 by October 2017. The National Guard and the Army Reserve will see a smaller expansion.\n\n\nThe Army's maneuver organization was most recently altered by the reorganization of \n into the \n, transferring the 1st and 4th Brigade Combat Teams of the \n under a separate operational headquarters to reflect the brigades' distinct, Arctic-oriented mission. As part of the reorganization, the 1–11 (formerly 1–25) Stryker Brigade Combat Team will reorganize as an Infantry Brigade Combat Team.\n Following this transition, the active component BCTs will number 11 Armored brigades, 6 Stryker brigades, and 14 Infantry brigades.\n\nWithin the Army National Guard and United States Army Reserve, there are a further eight divisions, 27 brigade combat teams, additional combat support and combat service support brigades, and independent cavalry, infantry, artillery, aviation, engineer and support battalions. The Army Reserve in particular provides virtually all psychological operations and civil affairs units.\n\n \n (FORSCOM)\n\n\n\nThe \n (AMEDD), formerly the Army Medical Service (AMS), is the primary healthcare organization of the United States Army and is led by the \n (TSG), a three-star \n, who (by policy) also serves as the Commanding General, \n (MEDCOM). TSG is assisted by a Deputy Surgeon General and a full staff, the Office of the Surgeon General (OTSG). The incumbent Surgeon General is Lieutenant General \n (since January 25, 2024).\n\nAMEDD encompasses the Army's six non-combat, medical-focused specialty branches (or \"Corps\"), these branches are: the \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n. Each of these branches is headed by a Corps Chief that reports directly to the Surgeon General.\n\n \n (Airborne) (USASOC):\n\n\nThe Army's Talent Management Task Force (TMTF) has deployed IPPS-A,\n the \n, an app which serves the National Guard, and on 17 January 2023 the Army Reserve and Active Army.\n Soldiers were reminded to update their information using the legacy systems to keep their payroll and personnel information current by December 2021. IPPS-A is the Human Resources system for the Army, is now available for download for Android, or the Apple store.\n It will be used for future promotions and other personnel decisions. Among the changes are:\n\nBelow are the U.S. Army ranks authorized for use today and their equivalent NATO designations. Although no living officer currently holds the rank of \n, it is still authorized by Congress for use in wartime.\n\nThere are several paths to becoming a \n including the \n, \n, \n, and \n. Regardless of which road an officer takes, the insignia are the same. Certain professions including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, lawyers and chaplains are commissioned directly into the Army.\n\nMost army commissioned officers (those who are generalists)\n are promoted based on an \"up or out\" system. A more flexible talent management process is underway.\n The \n of 1980 establishes rules for the timing of promotions and limits the number of officers that can serve at any given time.\n\nArmy regulations call for addressing all personnel with the rank of general as \"General (last name)\" regardless of the number of stars. Likewise, both colonels and lieutenant colonels are addressed as \"Colonel (last name)\" and first and second lieutenants as \"Lieutenant (last name)\".\n\n\n are single track, specialty officers with subject matter expertise in a particular area. They are initially appointed as warrant officers (in the rank of WO1) by the \n, but receive their \n upon promotion to chief warrant officer two (CW2).\n\nBy regulation, warrant officers are addressed as \"Mr. (last name)\" or \"Ms. (last name)\" by senior officers and as \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" by all enlisted personnel.\n However, many personnel address warrant officers as \"Chief (last name)\" within their units regardless of rank.\n\nSergeants and corporals are referred to as NCOs, short for \n.\n This distinguishes corporals from the more numerous specialists who have the same pay grade but do not exercise leadership responsibilities. Beginning in 2021, all corporals will be required to conduct \n for the NCO ranks, completing the \n (BLC), or else be laterally assigned as specialists. Specialists who have completed BLC and who have been recommended for promotion will be permitted to wear corporal rank before their recommended promotion as NCOs.\n\n\nPrivates and privates first class (E3) are addressed as \"Private (last name)\", specialists as \"Specialist (last name)\", corporals as \"Corporal (last name)\" and sergeants, staff sergeants, sergeants first class and master sergeants all as \"Sergeant (last name)\". First sergeants are addressed as \"First Sergeant (last name)\" and sergeants major and command sergeants major are addressed as \"Sergeant Major (last name)\".\n\n\nTraining in the U.S. Army is generally divided into two categories – individual and collective. Because of COVID-19 precautions, the first two weeks of \n — not including processing and out-processing – incorporate social distancing and indoor desk-oriented training. Once the recruits have tested negative for COVID-19 for two weeks, the remaining 8 weeks follow the traditional activities for most recruits,\n followed by Advanced Individualized Training (AIT) where they receive training for their \n. Some individual's MOSs range anywhere from 14 to 20 weeks of One Station Unit Training (OSUT), which combines Basic Training and AIT. The length of AIT school varies by the MOS. The length of time spent in AIT depends on the MOS of the soldier. Certain highly technical MOS training requires many months (e.g., foreign language translators). Depending on the needs of the army, \n for combat arms soldiers is conducted at a number of locations, but two of the longest-running are the Armor School and the \n, both at \n, Georgia. Sergeant Major of the Army Dailey notes that an infantrymen's pilot program for \n (OSUT) extends 8 weeks beyond Basic Training and AIT, to 22 weeks. The pilot, designed to boost infantry readiness ended in December 2018. The new Infantry OSUT covered the \n machine gun as well as the \n.\n The redesigned Infantry OSUT started in 2019.\n Depending on the result of the 2018 pilot, OSUTs could also extend training in other combat arms beyond the infantry.\n One Station Unit Training will be extended to 22 weeks for Armor by Fiscal Year 2021.\n Additional OSUTs are expanding to Cavalry, Engineer, and Military Police (MP) in the succeeding Fiscal Years.\n\n\nA new training assignment for junior officers was instituted, that they serve as platoon leaders for Basic Combat Training (BCT) platoons.\n These lieutenants will assume many of the administrative, logistical, and day-to-day tasks formerly performed by the drill sergeants of those platoons and are expected to \"lead, train, and assist with maintaining and enhancing the morale, welfare and readiness\" of the drill sergeants and their BCT platoons.\n These lieutenants are also expected to stem any inappropriate behaviors they witness in their platoons, to free up the drill sergeants for training.\n\n\nThe \n (ACFT) was introduced in 2018 to 60 battalions spread throughout the Army.\n The test and scoring system is the same for all soldiers, regardless of gender.  It takes an hour to complete, including resting periods.\n The ACFT supersedes the Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT),\n as being more relevant to survival in combat.\n Six events were determined to better predict which muscle groups of the body were adequately conditioned for combat actions:\n three deadlifts,\n a standing power throw of a ten-pound medicine ball,\n hand-release pushups\n (which replace the traditional pushup), a sprint/drag/carry 250 yard event,\n three pull-ups with leg tucks (or a plank test in lieu of the leg tuck),\n a mandatory rest period, and a two-mile run.\n As of 1 October 2020 all soldiers from all three components (Regular Army, Reserve, and National Guard)\n are subject to this test.\n The ACFT now tests all soldiers in basic training as of October 2020. The ACFT became the official test of record 1 October 2020; before that day every Army unit was required to complete a diagnostic ACFT\n (All Soldiers with valid APFT scores can use them until March 2022. The Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F) System is one way that soldiers can prepare.).\n The ACFT movements directly translate to movements on the battlefield.\n\nFollowing their basic and advanced training at the individual level, soldiers may choose to continue their training and apply for an \"additional skill identifier\" (ASI). The ASI allows the army to take a wide-ranging MOS and focus it on a more specific MOS. For example, a combat medic, whose duties are to provide pre-hospital emergency treatment, may receive ASI training to become a cardiovascular specialist, a dialysis specialist, or even a licensed practical nurse. For commissioned officers, training includes pre-commissioning training, known as Basic Officer Leader Course A, either at \n or via \n, or by completing \n. After commissioning, officers undergo branch-specific training at the Basic Officer Leaders Course B, (formerly called Officer Basic Course), which varies in time and location according to their future assignments. Officers will continue to attend standardized training at different stages of their careers.\n\n\nCollective training at the unit level takes place at the unit's assigned station, but the most intensive training at higher echelons is conducted at the three combat training centers (CTC); the \n (NTC) at \n, California, the \n (JRTC) at \n, Louisiana and the \n (JMRC) at the Hohenfels Training Area in \n,\n Germany. \n is the Army Force Generation process approved in 2020 to meet the need to continuously replenish forces for deployment, at unit level and for other echelons as required by the mission. Individual-level replenishment still requires training at a unit level, which is conducted at the continental U.S. (CONUS) replacement center (CRC) at \n, in New Mexico and Texas before their individual deployment.\n\n\nChief of Staff Milley notes that the Army is suboptimized for training in cold-weather regions, jungles, mountains, or urban areas where in contrast the Army does well when training for deserts or rolling terrain.\n Post 9/11, Army unit-level training was for counter-insurgency (COIN); by 2014–2017, training had shifted to decisive action training.\n\n\nThe \n has identified six modernization priorities, in order: artillery, ground vehicles, aircraft, network, air/missile defense, and soldier lethality.\n\n\nThe United States Army employs various weapons to provide light firepower at short ranges. The most common weapon type used by the army is the \n, a compact variant of the \n,\n along with the 7.62×51mm variant of the \n for \n.Then the future weapon is the M7, which fires a 6.8mm round. The primary sidearm in the U.S. Army is the 9 mm \n; the \n is also used. Both handguns are to be replaced by the \n through the \n program.\n Soldiers are also equipped with various \n, such as the \n and \n.\n\nMany units are supplemented with a variety of specialized weapons, including the \n (Squad Automatic Weapon), to provide suppressive fire at the squad level.\n Indirect fire is provided by the \n. The \n or the \n are used for \n and close-quarters combat. The \n is used by designated marksmen. Snipers use the \n, the \n and the \n.\n\nThe army employs various crew-served weapons to provide heavy firepower at ranges exceeding that of individual weapons.\n\nThe \n is the U.S. Army's standard Medium Machine Gun.\n The \n is generally used as a vehicle-mounted machine gun. In the same way, the 40 mm \n is mainly used by motorized units.\n\n\nThe U.S. Army uses three types of \n for indirect fire support when heavier artillery may not be appropriate or available. The smallest of these is the 60 mm \n, normally assigned at the infantry company level.\n At the next higher echelon, infantry battalions are typically supported by a section of 81 mm \n.\n The largest mortar in the army's inventory is the 120 mm \n, usually employed by mechanized units.\n\n\nFire support for light infantry units is provided by towed howitzers, including the 105 mm \n and the 155 mm \n.\n\n\nThe U.S. Army utilizes a variety of direct-fire rockets and missiles to provide infantry with an Anti-Armor Capability. The \n is an unguided projectile that can destroy armor and bunkers at ranges up to 500 meters. The \n is a shoulder-launched, heat seeking anti-aircraft missile. The \n and \n are anti-tank guided missiles.\n\nU.S. Army doctrine puts a premium on mechanized warfare. It fields the highest vehicle-to-soldier ratio in the world as of 2009.\n The army's most common vehicle is the High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle (HMMWV), commonly called the \n, which is capable of serving as a cargo/troop carrier, weapons platform and ambulance, among many other roles.\n While they operate a wide variety of combat support vehicles, one of the most common types centers on the family of \n vehicles. The \n is the army's \n,\n while the \n is the standard \n.\n Other vehicles include the \n,\n the \n and multiple types of \n (MRAP) vehicles.\n\nThe U.S. Army's principal \n weapons are the \n self-propelled howitzer\n and the \n (MLRS),\n both mounted on tracked platforms and assigned to heavy mechanized units.\n\nWhile the \n operates a few \n, it mainly operates several types of rotary-wing aircraft. These include the \n \n,\n the \n utility tactical transport helicopter\n and the \n heavy-lift transport helicopter.\n Restructuring plans call for reduction of 750 aircraft and from seven to four types.\n The Army is evaluating two fixed-wing aircraft demonstrators; ARES, and Artemis are under evaluation to replace the Guardrail ISR (Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) aircraft.\n Under the \n, the Army agreed to limit its fixed-wing aviation role to administrative mission support (light unarmed aircraft which cannot operate from forward positions). For \n, the Army is deploying at least one company of drone \n to each Active Army division.\n\n\nThe \n (ACU) currently features a camouflage pattern known as \n (OCP); OCP replaced a pixel-based pattern known as \n (UCP) in 2019.\n\nOn 11 November 2018, the Army announced a new version of 'Army Greens' based on uniforms worn during World War II that will become the standard garrison service uniform.\n The blue \n will remain as the dress uniform. The Army Greens are projected to be first fielded in the summer of 2020.\n\n\nThe \n of enlisted personnel displays their \n (shown above). The U.S. Army's black beret is no longer worn with the ACU for garrison duty, having been permanently replaced with the patrol cap. After years of complaints that it was not suited well for most work conditions, Army Chief of Staff General \n eliminated it for wear with the ACU in June 2011. Soldiers who are currently in a unit in jump status still wear berets, whether the wearer is parachute-qualified or not (maroon beret), while members of \n (SFABs) wear brown berets. Members of the 75th Ranger Regiment and the Airborne and Ranger Training Brigade (tan beret) and Special Forces (rifle green beret) may wear it with the Army Service Uniform for non-ceremonial functions. Unit commanders may still direct the wear of patrol caps in these units in training environments or motor pools.\n\nThe Army has relied heavily on \n to provide the various facilities needed while on deployment (Force Provider Expeditionary (FPE)).\n The most common tent uses for the military are as temporary \n (sleeping quarters), \n buildings (dining facilities),\n forward operating bases (FOBs), after-action review (AAR), tactical operations center (TOC), morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) facilities, as well as security checkpoints. Furthermore, most of these tents are set up and operated through the support of \n.  Each FPE contains billeting, latrines, showers, laundry and kitchen facilities for 50–150 Soldiers,\n and is stored in \n.  This provisioning allows combatant commanders to position soldiers as required in their \n, within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nThe U.S. Army is beginning to use a more modern tent called the \n (DRASH). In 2008, DRASH became part of the Army's Standard Integrated Command Post System.\n\n"},

In April 2018, Oliver founded \n, which owned the van labeled \"Vanned Parenthood\" (a reference to \n), for a segment about \n. In June 2021, Oliver set up a church in Florida called \n, which owned the \n \"JohnnyCare\", satirizing the lack of regulations on such ministries.\n\nOn August 16, 2015, \n broadcast a segment about \n, the practice of using television broadcasts for Christian church services. In the segment, Oliver criticized televangelists like \n and \n for using donations from their programs to pay for private luxuries and pointed out that such donations were \n under the U.S. \n's (IRS) regulations.\n The host opined that part of this was due to the IRS's lax requirements; he pointed out that only three churches were audited in 2013 and 2014.\n Oliver established Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption partly to demonstrate the lack of legal requirements to establish a tax-exempt religious organization and to illustrate the \"disturbingly easy\" process.\n The host explained that he was able to found the church due to \"vague\" legal restrictions. He chose his New York City studio for the church's official location,\n but registered the \n in \n.\n During the satirical \n segment of the episode, the comedian \n appeared as John Oliver's fictional wife Wanda Jo Oliver; she later reprised the role in episodes featuring spinoffs of the church and in \n 2019 segment about \n.\n The \"\n\" used a \n to permit callers to donate to the church, and said that all monetary donations would be redistributed to the charitable relief organization \n upon the church's dissolution.\n\n\nOliver criticized the practices used by televangelists for donations, which included promising that donations and prayer would cure sickness or that donations would get rid of \n.\n In his broadcast on August 16, the host revealed letters of his months-long correspondence with Tilton, in which he initially sent $20 to Tilton's church and received a letter back asking for more in donations; by the end of the correspondence, he had received a total of 26 letters and donated $319.\n Oliver criticized pastors such as Tilton, Copeland and his wife Gloria, \n, and others for using the IRS's religious tax breaks for personal luxuries.\n\n\nOliver later announced that in response to the episode, viewers of \n had sent in \"thousands of dollars\", international currency, a check for $65\nbillion, and different packages of seeds, including semen (in reference to the \"\n\" gospel the show was parodying).\n Callers to the toll-free number heard a pre-recorded message from Oliver demanding donations.\n\n\nA week after the announcement of the church's creation, Oliver devoted a short segment of his show to the donations the church had received, which included money from around the world. Oliver said he had received \"thousands of envelopes with thousands of dollars\" from donors, displaying several \n containers full of mail. Oliver told viewers that the more money they sent in, the more \"blessings\" would be returned to them, adding that \"that is still something I'm—amazingly—legally allowed to say\".\n\n\nOn September 13, 2015, Oliver announced on \n that he was closing Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption.\n A message on the church's website stated: \"We're also not closing down because you all kept sending us actual seeds, even though we explicitly told you not to. We're closing because multiple people sent us \n through the mail.\"\n Upon the church's dissolution, Oliver announced that the tens of thousands of dollars received would be donated to Doctors Without Borders and mockingly said that \"if you want to send money to a fake church, send it to \n\".\n\n\nMatt Wilstein, writing in \n, compared Oliver's stunt to the comedian \n's \"\n\", which Colbert used to test the limits of the 2010 Supreme Court decision in \n.\n Many reviewers agreed with Oliver's characterization of televangelists as \"frauds\".\n Some reviewers found that Oliver's criticism of the IRS was incomplete and useless;\n others criticized Oliver's failure to discuss the long history of tax-exempt status for churches.\n Steve Thorngate, writing in \n, suggested that the question of religious tax exemption was more difficult and nuanced than Oliver portrayed, and not a simple matter of government regulation. However, Thorngate agreed that Oliver's exposure and criticism of televangelists was accurate.\n After the segment aired, the IRS was pressured to investigate televangelists and their use of tax-exempt status.\n The IRS and the televangelists discussed in the segment did not publicly comment.\n\n\nOn April 8, 2018, \n broadcast a segment about \n (CPCs), which dissuade pregnant women from getting abortions, often through misinformation.\n Oliver highlighted an image of a van that would park outside centers to advertise free \n.\n Oliver filed paperwork in New York to start the nonprofit Our Lady of Choosing Choice, which owned the CPC van labeled \"Vanned Parenthood\" (a reference to \n).\n Oliver announced the van at the end of the segment on CPCs with Rachel Dratch as Wanda Jo, who made multiple incorrect medical claims to point out the right CPC workers have to misinform patients.\n Oliver finished the segment by saying: \"This is all perfectly legal and there is absolutely nothing stopping us from parking outside an abortion clinic tonight and haranguing people in the morning.\"\n \n organizations and CPC operators criticized the segment for presenting a \"one-sided\" argument, with one CPC founder calling it a \"hate piece\".\n\n\nOn June 27, 2021, \n broadcast a segment about \n (HCSMs), which are religion-based organizations where members' \n directly pay the \n of other members, exempt from tax. Oliver discussed the lack of regulation on HCSMs, allowing the organizations to deny coverage for anything, and advocated for states to pass laws mandating that HCSMs disclose their practices and properly allocate funds.\n In 2018, Florida eased restrictions on HCSMs, changing the criteria from mandating that an HCSM have people of the same religion to having people who \"share a common set of ethical or religious beliefs\".\n Due to the lax requirements, Oliver founded the church Our Lady of Perpetual Health, which owned the HCSM \"JohnnyCare\".\n Oliver announced the new organization in an informercial at the end of the \n segment about HCSMs, bringing back Rachel Dratch as Wanda Jo.\n Oliver stated that 5,000 Florida residents could sign up for a $1.99 fee and receive a JohnnyCare-branded set of bandages in return.\n\n"},

He is credited with founding \n, with his student \n. Leucippus divided the world into two entities: atoms, indivisible particles that make up all things, and \n, the nothingness between the atoms. Leucippus's ideas were influential in ancient and \n philosophy. They were a precursor to modern \n, but the two are only superficially similar. Leucippus's atoms come in infinitely many forms, all in constant motion, creating a \n world created by the collisions of atoms. The soul is viewed as an arrangement of spherical atoms, cycled through the body by respiration and creating thought and sensory input. Little is known of his life, with a few scholars doubting that he existed, attributing his ideas purely to Democritus.

The Allies considered \n to be a major threat to their shipping and after several \n heavy bomber raids failed to inflict any damage it was decided to use \n \n instead. Operation Title involved a pair of two-man British Chariots which were transported to Norway on board a small boat named \n. Both Chariots were lost when bad weather caused them to detach from \n on 31 October. It was not possible for the Allied boat to reach the sea due to German security measures, and \n was \n.

She and Yesügei had three sons and one daughter, as well as Temüjin. After Yesügei was fatally poisoned and the Mongols abandoned her family, Hö'elün shepherded all her children through poverty to adulthood—her resilience and organisational skills have been remarked upon by historians. She continued to play an important role after Temüjin's marriage to \n. Hö'elün married Münglig, an old \n of Yesügei, in thanks for his support after a damaging defeat. During the next decades, she arranged marriages, maintained alliances, and was heavily involved in disputes between Genghis, his brothers, and Münglig's sons.

It was the first court ruling in Illinois to hold that private messages were subject to disclosure under the state's \n (FOIA). The case addressed a public records request from a reporter for \n in \n, who observed city council members and the mayor using their personal electronic devices to send messages during a city council meeting. City officials denied the reporter's request; the case eventually reached the Appellate Court, which held that public officials have to disclose their records, even if they are stored on a personal electronic device or account, but only when acting as a \n, such as during a council meeting.

McQueen's design is a one-shouldered dress in \n beige silk \n with a \n upper body and a full-length skirt consisting of hundreds of individual circles of \n sewn in dense layers to the base fabric, resembling an \n shell. The dress originated as a reinterpretation of the \"shellfish dress\" designed by \n in 1987, which McQueen had long admired and sought to emulate. Contemporary critical response to McQueen's oyster dress was positive and it is considered an iconic piece of McQueen's work. Only two copies are known to exist, one held by the \n (the Met) in New York City and one by media personality \n.

The MEVC has warm summers and cold, snowy winters;  snow and ice remain on the highest peaks year-round. \n have lived adjacent to the MEVC for thousands of years. Historically, the local \n people used \n from the MEVC to make tools and weaponry. Animal species such as birds, rodents, bears, sheep, goats, moose and caribou inhabit the area. A \n dominates the MEVC which can only be accessed by aircraft or by a network of \n. (\n)\n\n\n\n is the \n of \n, encompassing \n and surrounding islets. With a population of 794,313 as of 2020\n, it is the \n of Malaysia's \n, which has a population of 2.84 million. George Town serves as the commercial centre for northern Malaysia. Its technological sector, anchored by hundreds of \n, has made the city the \n. George Town was the first British settlement in \n, and its proximity to maritime routes along the \n attracted an influx of immigrants from various parts of Asia. In 1974, the city was \n with the rest of the island, throwing its administrative status into doubt until 2015, when its jurisdiction was reinstated and expanded to cover the entire island and adjacent islets. \n designated the \n as a \n in 2008. (\n)\n\n\n\nThe \n was an \n match between \n and \n for the 138th \n. In the 21st minute, \n's shot struck \n's arm; the referee declined to award a penalty and showed Doucouré the first \n of the game for his protests. \n scored the first goal from a \n and \n side-footed the ball for the second goal. At 61 minutes City extended their lead with a goal from \n \n \n, and seven minutes later, Jesus scored on the counter-attack. Sterling scored twice at the 81st and the 87th minutes and the match ended 6–0 to Manchester City. De Bruyne was named \n. It was only the third time that a team has scored six goals in an FA Cup final and the margin of victory is the joint-largest in an FA Cup final. The win completed a \n for Manchester City, who already won the \n and the \n that season. (\n)\n\n\n\n\"\n\" is a \n \n by American writer \n. First published in \n in August 1974, it was republished in her \n (1975). Set in her fictional \n, the story has strong connections to her novel \n (also 1974), and is sometimes referred to as a prologue to the novel. The story follows Odo, an aging \n, who over the course of a day relives memories of her life as an activist as she learns of plans for a \n the next day. The strike is implied to be the start of the revolt leading to the idealized anarchist society based on Odo's teachings depicted in the novel. The story was critically well-received. It won the \n and \n for Best Short Story in 1975, and was also nominated for a \n. Multiple scholars commented that it represented a shift in Le Guin's writing toward non-linear narrative structures and works infused with feminism. (\n)\n\n\n\n was the last of five \n of the \n built for the \n. \n in May 1904, she was named for the then-German province of \n. The ship was armed with a battery of four \n and had a top speed of 18 \n (33 \n; 21 \n). She was to be replaced in July 1914 by \n but \n prevented her retirement. The ship and the rest of II Squadron joined the dreadnoughts of the \n to support a \n in December 1914. She primarily served as a \n in the \n; in poor condition by 1916, she was withdrawn from fleet service in February. She thereafter patrolled the \n until replaced by the battleship \n in September 1917. After the war, she was converted into a \n for F-type \n and placed in reserve in March 1920. \n (\n)\n\n\n\n (died 24 June 1124) was \n of the \n priory of \n from about 1115 until his death. He was born around the time of the \n. It is not known who his parents were, but \n wrote that he was \"of exalted descent\",and it has been argued that he was a son of King \n. Nicholas was the favourite pupil of \n, \n, who brought him up. Wulfstan was influential in transmitting Old English culture to Anglo-Norman England, and Nicholas carried on this work as prior. He was respected by the chroniclers, William of Malmesbury, \n and \n for his assistance with their histories. Nicholas was an English monk at a time when both Englishmen and monks rarely received promotion in the church, and when Bishop \n of Worcester died in October 1123, Nicholas led an unsuccessful attempt of the monks of the priory chapter to be allowed to choose the next bishop. (\n)\n\n\n\nThe \n is a \n leading to the \n of the \n. It was constructed largely of repurposed material taken from the fourth century BCE \n and integrated into the \n, a late Roman fortification built around the Acropolis in the years following \n by the Germanic \n people in 267 or early 268 CE. Its construction marked the beginning of a new phase in the Acropolis's use, in which it came to be seen more as a defensive position than in the religious terms. During the \n, the gate was further fortified, before being built over with a \n in \n times. The monument was discovered by the French archaeologist \n on 29 May 1852, and excavated in 1852 and 1853. Archaeologists and Greek commentators criticised the aggressive means – particularly the use of explosives. In modern times, the gate has served primarily as an exit for tourists from the Acropolis. (\n)\n\n\n\nThe \n was a \n that burned 17,788 acres (7,199 ha) of the \n and \n. The fire was ignited on June 1 when lightning struck a spot on the northeast side of \n within the Coconino National Forest. The fire spread rapidly because of high temperatures, steep terrain, leftovers from a wildfire in 2000, and high wind speeds. The winds blew smoke over local communities and infrastructure, leading to the closure of \n from June 8 to June 21. Smoke was also visible from the \n. The Boundary Fire burned out on July 3, 2017, after 32 days of firefighting. The cost of managing the fire was $9.4 million (equivalent to $11.5 million in 2023). Damage to the area's foliage increased the risk of landslides into 2018. The Boundary Fire was one of 2,321 wildfires in Arizona in 2017 that burned a total of 429,564 acres (173,838 ha). (\n)\n\n\n\nThe \n took place from May to July 1352 when a French army under \n unsuccessfully attempted to recapture the French castle at \n which had been seized by the English the previous January. The siege was part of the \n and took place during the uneasy and ill-kept \n. The strongly fortified castle had been taken by the English during a period of nominal truce and the English king, \n, decided to keep it. Charny led 4,500 men and retook the town but was unable to either recapture or \n the castle. After two months of fierce fighting, a large English night attack on the French camp inflicted a heavy defeat and the French withdrew. Guînes was incorporated into the \n. The threat posed by this enclave caused the French to garrison 60 fortified positions around it, at ruinous expense. The castle was besieged by the French in 1436 and 1514, but was relieved each time, before falling to the French in 1558. (\n)\n"},

{"title": "Cosplay - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n, a \n of \"costume play\", is an activity and \n in which participants called \n wear \n and \n to represent a specific \n.\n Cosplayers often interact to create a \n, and a broader use of the term \"cosplay\" applies to any costumed \n in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject. Favorite sources include \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n \n, \n and in some cases, original characters. The term is composed of the two aforementioned counterparts – costume and role play.\n\nCosplay grew out of the practice of fan costuming at \n, beginning with \n's \"futuristicostumes\" created for the \n held in \n in 1939.\n The Japanese term \"cosplay\"\n was coined in 1984. A rapid growth in the number of people cosplaying as a \n since the 1990s has made the phenomenon a significant aspect of \n in \n, as well as in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world. Cosplay events are common features of \n, and today there are many dedicated conventions and competitions, as well as \n, websites, and other forms of media centered on cosplay activities. Cosplay is very popular among all genders, and it is not unusual to see \n, also referred to as gender-bending.\n\nThe term \"cosplay\" is a Japanese \n of the English terms \n and play.\n The term was coined by \n of Studio Hard\n after he attended the \n (\n) in Los Angeles\n and saw costumed fans, which he later wrote about in an article for the Japanese magazine \n.\n Takahashi decided to coin a new word rather than use the existing translation of the English term \"masquerade\" because that translates into Japanese as \"an aristocratic costume\", which did not match his experience of the Worldcon.\n The coinage reflects a common \n in which the first two \n of a pair of words are used to form an independent compound: 'costume' becomes \n (コス) and 'play' becomes \n (プレ).\n\nMasquerade balls were a feature of the \n season in the 15th century, and involved increasingly elaborate allegorical \n, pageants, and triumphal processions celebrating marriages and other dynastic events of late medieval court life. They were extended into costumed public festivities in \n during the 16th century \n, generally elaborate dances held for members of the upper classes, which were particularly popular in \n.\n\nIn April 1877, \n sent out almost 700 invitations for an elaborate costume ball, where several of the guests showed up dressed as characters from Verne's novels.\n\n\nCostume parties (American English) or fancy dress parties (British English) were popular from the 19th century onwards. Costuming guides of the period, such as Samuel Miller's \n (1884)\n or Ardern Holt's \n (1887),\n feature mostly generic costumes, whether that be period costumes, national costumes, objects or abstract concepts such as \"Autumn\" or \"Night\". Most specific costumes described therein are for historical figures although some are sourced from fiction, like \n or \n characters.\n\nBy March 1891, a literal call by one Herbert Tibbits for what would today be described as \"cosplayers\" was advertised for an event held from 5–10 March that year at the \n in London, for the so-named \n based on \n and its characters, published two decades earlier.\n\n\n's science fiction \n character \n (a Martian ethnographer who comically misunderstands many Earthly affairs) is arguably the first fictional character that people emulated by wearing costumes, as in 1908 Mr. and Mrs. William Fell of \n, are reported to have attended a masquerade at a skating rink wearing Mr. Skygack and Miss Dillpickles costumes. Later, in 1910, an unnamed woman won first prize at masquerade ball in \n, wearing another Skygack costume.\n\n\nThe first people to wear costumes to attend a convention were science fiction fans \n and Myrtle R. Douglas, known in fandom as \n. They attended the 1939 \n (Nycon or 1st \n) in the Caravan Hall, New York, US dressed in \"futuristicostumes\", including green cape and breeches, based on the \n artwork of \n and the 1936 film \n, designed and created by Douglas.\n \n\nAckerman later stated that he thought everyone was supposed to wear a costume at a science fiction convention, although only he and Douglas did.\n\n\nFan costuming caught on, however, and the \n (1940) had both an unofficial masquerade held in Douglas' room and an official masquerade as part of the programme.\n \n won the masquerade wearing a \n costume created by \n, while \n received second place with a Bar Senestro costume (from the novel \n by \n and \n).\n Other costumed attendees included guest of honor \n as \n (from \n's series of short stories) and both Ackerman and Douglas wearing their futuristicostumes again.\n Masquerades and costume balls continued to be part of \n tradition thereafter.\n Early Worldcon masquerade balls featured a band, dancing, food and drinks. Contestants either walked across a stage or a cleared area of the dance floor.\n\n\nAckerman wore a \"Hunchbackerman of Notre Dame\" costume to the \n (1941), which included a mask designed and created by \n, but soon stopped wearing costumes to conventions.\n Douglas wore an Akka costume (from \n's novel \n), the mask again made by Harryhausen, to the 3rd Worldcon and a Snake Mother costume (another Merritt costume, from \n) to the \n (1946).\n Terminology was yet unsettled; the 1944 edition of \n's \n used the term \n.\n\n\nRules governing costumes became established in response to specific costumes and costuming trends.  The first nude contestant at a Worldcon masquerade was in 1952; but the height of this trend was in the 1970s and early 1980s, with a few every year.\n  This eventually led to \"No Costume is No Costume\" rule, which banned full nudity, although partial nudity was still allowed as long as it was a legitimate representation of the character.\n \n describes the best of the nude costumes as Kris Lundi wearing a \n costume to the \n (1974) (she received an honorable mention in the competition).\n Another costume that instigated a rule change was an attendee at the \n (1962) whose blaster prop fired a jet of real flame; which led to fire being banned.\n  At the \n (1972), artist \n wore a costume composed largely of peanut butter to represent his own \n character called \"The Turd\".  The peanut butter rubbed off, doing damage to soft furnishings and other peoples' costumes, and then began to go rancid under the heat of the lighting.  Food, odious, and messy substances were banned as costume elements after that event.\n\n\nCostuming spread with the \n and the interaction of \n.  The earliest known instance of costuming at a convention in the United Kingdom was at the \n (1953) but this was only as part of a play.  However, members of the Liverpool Science Fantasy Society attended the 1st Cytricon (1955), in \n, wearing costumes and continued to do so in subsequent years.\n The \n (1957) brought the first official convention masquerade to the UK.\n The 1960 \n in London may have been the first British-based convention to hold an official fancy dress party as part of its programme.\n\nThe joint winners were Ethel Lindsay and Ina Shorrock as two of the titular witches from the novel \n by \n.\n\n\n conventions began in 1969 and major conventions began in 1972 and they have featured cosplay throughout.\n\n\nIn Japan, costuming at conventions was a fan activity from at least the 1970s, especially after the launch of the \n convention in December 1975.\n  Costuming at this time was known as \n.\n  The first documented case of costuming at a fan event in Japan was at \n (1978), in \n, at which future science fiction critic \n wore a costume based on the cover art for \n' novel \n.\n In an interview Kotani states that there were about twenty costumed attendees at the convention's costume party—made up of members of her \n fan club and Kansai Entertainers\n, antecedent of the \n anime studio—with most attendees in ordinary clothing.\n  One of the Kansai group, an unnamed friend of \n, wore an impromptu \n costume (from the film \n) made from one of the host-hotel's rolls of toilet paper.\n Costume contests became a permanent part of the \n conventions from Tokon VII in 1980.\n\nPossibly the first costume contest held at a \n was at the \n held at \n in New York in August 1965.\n \n, future editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics but then just transitioning from a \n editor to a professional comic book writer, attended in a \n costume.\n\n\nThe first Masquerade Ball held at \n was in 1974 during the convention's 6th event.  Voice actress \n was the \n.\n  Future \n \n won first place wearing a \n costume.\n Ackerman (who was the creator of Vampirella) was in attendance and posed with Stevens for photographs.  They became friends and, according to Stevens \"Forry and his wife, Wendayne, soon became like my god parents.\"\n  Photographer Dan Golden saw a photograph of Stevens in the Vampirella costume while visiting Ackerman's house, leading to him hiring her for a non-speaking role in her first student film, \n (1980), and later photographing her for the cover of the first issue of \n (1992).\n  Stevens attributes these events to launching her acting career.\n\n\nAs early as a year after the 1975 release of \n, audience members began dressing as characters from the movie and role-playing (although the initial incentive for dressing-up was free admission) in often highly accurate costumes.\n\n\nCostume-Con, a conference dedicated to costuming, was first held in January 1983.\n The International Costumers Guild, Inc., originally known as the Greater Columbia Fantasy Costumer's Guild, was launched after the 3rd Costume-Con (1985) as a parent organization and to support costuming.\n\n\nCostuming had been a fan activity in Japan from the 1970s, and it became much more popular in the wake of Takahashi's report.  The new term did not catch on immediately, however.  It was a year or two after the article was published before it was in common use among fans at conventions.\n  It was in the 1990s, after exposure on television and in magazines, that the term and practice of cosplaying became common knowledge in Japan.\n\n\nThe first cosplay cafés appeared in the \n area of Tokyo in the late 1990s.\n  A temporary \n was set up at the Tokyo Character Collection event in August 1998 to promote the video game \n (1997).\n  An occasional Pia Carrot Restaurant was held at the shop Gamers in Akihabara in the years up to 2000.\n  Being linked to specific intellectual properties limited the lifespan of these cafés, which was solved by using generic maids, leading to the first permanent establishment, Cure Maid Café, which opened in March 2001.\n\n\nThe first \n was held on 12 October 2003 at the Rose Court Hotel in Nagoya, Japan, with five cosplayers invited from Germany, France and Italy.  There was no contest until 2005, when the World Cosplay Championship began.  The first winners were the Italian team of Giorgia Vecchini, \n and Emilia Fata Livia.\n\nWorldcon masquerade attendance peaked in the 1980s and started to fall thereafter.  This trend was reversed when the concept of cosplay was re-imported from Japan.\n\n\nCosplay costumes vary greatly and can range from simple themed clothing to highly detailed costumes. It is generally considered different from \n and \n costume wear, as the intention is to replicate a specific character, rather than to reflect the culture and symbolism of a holiday event. As such, when in costume, some cosplayers often seek to adopt the affect, mannerisms, and \n of the characters they portray (with \"out of character\" breaks). The characters chosen to be cosplayed may be sourced from any movie, TV series, book, comic book, video game, music band, anime, or manga. Some cosplayers even choose to cosplay an original character of their own design or a fusion of different genres (e.g., a \n version of a character), and it is a part of the ethos of cosplay that anybody can be anything, as with \n, \n, or \n, a cosplayer playing a character of another ethnicity, or a \n portraying \n.\n  \nCosplayers obtain their apparel through many different methods. Manufacturers produce and sell packaged outfits for use in cosplay, with varying levels of quality. These costumes are often sold online, but also can be purchased from dealers at conventions. Japanese manufacturers of cosplay costumes reported a profit of 35 billion yen in 2008.\n A number of individuals also work on commission, creating custom costumes, \n, or wigs designed and fitted to the individual. Other cosplayers, who prefer to create their own costumes, still provide a market for individual elements, and various \n, such as unstyled \n, hair dye, cloth and sewing notions, \n, \n, \n, and prop weapons.\n\nCosplay represents an act of \n. Cosplay has been closely linked to the \n,\n yet cosplayers' ability to perform is limited by their physical features. The accuracy of a cosplay is judged based on the ability to accurately represent a character through the body, and individual cosplayers frequently are faced by their own \"bodily limits\"\n such as level of attractiveness, body size, and disability\n that often restrict and confine how accurate the cosplay is perceived to be. Authenticity is measured by a cosplayer's individual ability to translate on-screen manifestation to the cosplay itself. Some have argued that cosplay can never be a true representation of the character; instead, it can only be read through the body, and that true embodiment of a character is judged based on nearness to the original character form.\n Cosplaying can also help some of those with self-esteem problems.\n\n\nMany cosplayers create their own outfits, referencing images of the characters in the process. In the creation of the outfits, much time is given to detail and qualities, thus the skill of a cosplayer may be measured by how difficult the details of the outfit are and how well they have been replicated. Because of the difficulty of replicating some details and materials, cosplayers often educate themselves in crafting specialties such as \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and other uses of materials in the effort to render the look and texture of a costume accurately.\n Cosplayers often wear wigs in conjunction with their outfit to further improve the resemblance to the character. This is especially necessary for anime and manga or video-game characters who often have unnaturally colored and uniquely styled hair. Simpler outfits may be compensated for their lack of complexity by paying attention to material choice and overall high quality.\n\nTo look more like the characters they are portraying, cosplayers might also engage in various forms of \n. Cosplayers may opt to change their skin color utilizing make-up to more simulate the race of the character they are adopting.\n \n that match the color of their character's eyes are a common form of this, especially in the case of characters with particularly unique eyes as part of their trademark look. Contact lenses that make the pupil look enlarged to visually echo the large eyes of anime and manga characters are also used.\n Another form of body modification in which cosplayers engage is to copy any tattoos or special markings their character might have. \n, \n, body paint, and in rare cases, permanent tattoos, are all methods used by cosplayers to achieve the desired look. Permanent and temporary \n, spray-in \n, and specialized extreme styling products are all used by some cosplayers whose natural hair can achieve the desired hairstyle. It is also commonplace for them to shave off their eyebrows to gain a more accurate look.\n\nSome anime and video game characters have weapons or other accessories that are hard to replicate, and conventions have strict rules regarding those weapons, but most cosplayers engage in some combination of methods to obtain all the items necessary for their costumes; for example, they may commission a prop weapon, sew their own clothing, buy character jewelry from a cosplay accessory manufacturer, or buy a pair of off-the-rack shoes, and modify them to match the desired look.\n\nCosplay may be presented in a number of ways and places. A subset of cosplay culture is centered on \n, with cosplayers specifically choosing characters known for their attractiveness or revealing costumes. However, wearing a revealing costume can be a sensitive issue while appearing in public.\n People appearing naked at American \n conventions during the 1970s were so common, a \"no costume is no costume\" rule was introduced.\n Some conventions throughout the United States, such as \n (now known as \n) and \n,\n have also issued rules upon which they reserve the right to ask attendees to leave or change their costumes if deemed to be inappropriate to a family-friendly environment or something of a similar nature.\n\nThe most popular form of presenting a cosplay publicly is by wearing it to a \n. Multiple conventions dedicated to anime and manga, comics, TV shows, video games, science fiction, and fantasy may be found all around the world. Cosplay-centered conventions include \n in the Philippines and \n in Singapore.\n\nThe single largest event featuring cosplay is the semiannual \n market, Comic Market (\n), held in Japan during summer and winter. Comiket attracts hundreds of thousands of manga and anime fans, where thousands of cosplayers congregate on the roof of the exhibition center. In North America, the highest-attended \n featuring cosplayers are the \n and \n held in the United States, and the \n \n in Toronto, \n held in Washington, D.C. and \n held in Los Angeles. Europe's largest event is \n held in Paris, while the \n and the \n are the most notable in the UK. \n is Australia's biggest event.\n\n conventions have featured cosplay for many decades. These include \n, a UK convention, and \n, a US convention.\n\nIn different comic fairs, \"Thematic Areas\" are set up where cosplayers can take photos in an environment that follows that of the game or animation product from which they are taken. Sometimes the cosplayers are part of the area, playing the role of staff with the task of entertaining the other visitors. Some examples are the thematic areas dedicated to Star Wars or to Fallout. The areas are set up by not for profit associations of fans, but in some major fairs it is possible to visit areas set up directly by the developers of the video games or the producers of the anime.\n\nThe appearance of cosplayers at public events makes them a popular draw for photographers.\n As this became apparent in the late 1980s, a new variant of cosplay developed in which cosplayers attended events mainly for the purpose of \n their characters for still photography rather than engaging in continuous role play. Rules of etiquette were developed to minimize awkward situations involving boundaries. Cosplayers pose for photographers and photographers do not press them for personal contact information or private sessions, follow them out of the area, or take photos without permission. The rules allow the collaborative relationship between photographers and cosplayers to continue with the least inconvenience to each other.\n\n\nSome cosplayers choose to have a professional photographer take high quality images of them in their costumes posing as the character. Cosplayers and photographers frequently exhibit their work online and sometimes sell their images.\n\n\nAs the popularity of cosplay has grown, many conventions have come to feature a contest surrounding cosplay that may be the main feature of the convention. Contestants present their cosplay, and often to be judged for an award, the cosplay must be self-made. The contestants may choose to perform a skit, which may consist of a short performed script or dance with optional accompanying audio, video, or images shown on a screen overhead. Other contestants may simply choose to pose as their characters. Often, contestants are briefly interviewed on stage by a \n. The audience is given a chance to take photos of the cosplayers. Cosplayers may compete solo or in a group. Awards are presented, and these awards may vary greatly. Generally, a best cosplayer award, a best group award, and runner-up prizes are given. Awards may also go to the best skit and a number of cosplay skill subcategories, such as master tailor, master weapon-maker, master armorer, and so forth.\n\nThe most well-known cosplay contest event is the \n, selecting cosplayers from 40 countries to compete in the final round in \n, Japan. Some other international events include European Cosplay Gathering (finals taking place at Japan Expo in Paris),\n EuroCosplay (finals taking place at London MCM Comic Con),\n and the Nordic Cosplay Championship (finals taking place at NärCon in \n, Sweden).\n\n\nThis table contains a list of the most common cosplay competition judging criteria, as seen from World Cosplay Summit,\n \n,\n and ReplayFX.\n\n\nPortraying a character of the opposite sex is called \n. The practicality of crossplay and cross-dress stems in part from the abundance in manga of male characters with delicate and somewhat androgynous features. Such characters, known as \n (lit. \"pretty boy\"),\n are Asian equivalent of the elfin boy archetype represented in Western tradition by figures such as \n and \n.\n\n\nMale to female cosplayers may experience issues when trying to portray a female character because it is hard to maintain the sexualized femininity of a character. Male cosplayers may also be subjected to discrimination,\n including homophobic comments and being touched without permission. This affects men possibly even more often than it affects women, despite inappropriate contact already being a problem for women who cosplay,\n as is \"\n\".\n\n\n players, a niche group in the realm of cosplay, are often male cosplayers who use \n and stylized masks to represent female \n characters. These cosplayers completely hide their real features so the original appearance of their characters may be reproduced as literally as possible, and to display all the abstractions and stylizations such as oversized eyes and tiny mouths often seen in Japanese cartoon art.\n This does not mean that only males perform \n or that masks are only female.\n\n\"Cosplay Is Not Consent\", a movement started in 2013 by Rochelle Keyhan, Erin Filson, and Anna Kegler, brought attention to the issue of \n in the \n attending cosplay community.\n Harassment of cosplayers include photography without permission, verbal abuse, touching, and groping. Harassment is not limited to women in provocative outfits as male cosplayers talked about being bullied for not fitting certain costume and characters.\n\nStarting in 2014, \n placed large signs at the entrance stating that \"Cosplay is Not Consent\". Attendees were reminded to ask permission for photos and respect the person's right to say no.\n The movement against sexual harassment against cosplayers has continued to gain momentum and awareness since being publicized. Traditional mainstream news media like \n and \n have reported on the topic, bringing awareness of sexual harassment to those outside of the cosplay community.\n\n\nAs cosplay has entered more mainstream media, ethnicity becomes a controversial point. Cosplayers of different skin color than the character are often ridiculed for not being 'accurate' or 'faithful'.\n Many cosplayers feel as if anyone can cosplay any character, but it becomes complicated when cosplayers are not respectful of the character's ethnicity.\n These views against non-white cosplayers within the community have been attributed to the lack of representation in the industry and in media.\n Issues such as \n, \n, and \n are still controversial since a large part of the cosplay community see these as separate problems, or simply an acceptable part of cosplay.\n\n\nCosplay has influenced the advertising industry, in which cosplayers are often used for event work previously assigned to agency models.\n Some cosplayers have thus transformed their hobby into profitable, professional careers.\n Japan's entertainment industry has been home to the professional cosplayers since the rise of Comiket and \n.\n The phenomenon is most apparent in Japan but exists to some degree in other countries as well. Professional cosplayers who profit from their art may experience problems related to \n.\n\n\nA cosplay model, also known as a cosplay idol, cosplays costumes for anime and manga or video game companies. Good cosplayers are viewed as fictional characters in the flesh, in much the same way that film actors come to be identified in the public mind with specific roles. Cosplayers have modeled for print magazines like \n and a successful cosplay model can become the \n for companies like \n. Some cosplay models can achieve significant recognition. While there are many significant cosplay models, \n was described as having emerged \"as a well-recognized figure both within and outside cosplay circuits\".\n \n, used her recognition in cosplay to gain other opportunities such as voice acting and her own documentary on \n.  \n used her fanbase to take her cosplay from a hobby to a successful business venture, sparking debate through the cosplay community whether cosplayers should be allowed to fund and profit from their work.\n\n\nIn the 2000s, cosplayers started to push the boundaries of cosplay into eroticism paving the way to \"erocosplay\".\n The advent of social media coupled with crowdfuding platforms like \n and \n have allowed cosplay models to turn cosplay into profitable full-time careers.\n\n\nCosplayers in Japan used to refer to themselves as \n, pronounced \"layer\". Currently in Japan, cosplayers are more commonly called \n, pronounced \"ko-su-pray\", as \n is more often used to describe layers (i.e. hair, clothes, etc.).\n Words like cute (\n (可愛い)) and cool (\n (かっこ いい)) were often used to describe these changes,\n expressions that were tied with notions of femininity and masculinity.\n Those who photograph players are called \n, short for \n or \n. Originally, the cameko gave prints of their photos to players as gifts. Increased interest in cosplay events, both on the part of photographers and cosplayers willing to model for them, has led to formalization of procedures at events such as Comiket. Photography takes place within a designated area removed from the exhibit hall. In Japan, costumes are generally not welcome outside of conventions or other designated areas.\n\n\nSince 1998, Tokyo's \n district contains a number of \n, catering to devoted anime and cosplay fans, where the waitresses at such cafés dress as video game or anime characters; \n are particularly popular. In Japan, Tokyo's \n district is the favorite informal gathering place to engage in cosplay in public. Events in Akihabara also draw many cosplayers.\n\n is a form of Japanese cosplay where the players use \n to make their skin color match that of the character they are playing. This allows them to represent \n or video game characters with non-human skin colors.\n\n\nA 2014 survey for the Comic Market convention in Japan noted that approximately 75% of cosplayers attending the event are female.\n\n\nCosplay is common in many East Asian countries. For example, it is a major part of the \n conventions taking place regularly in South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n Historically, the practice of dressing up as characters from works of fiction can be traced as far as the 17th century late \n China.\n\n\nWestern cosplay's origins are based primarily in science fiction and fantasy \n. It is also more common for Western cosplayers to recreate characters from live-action series than it is for Japanese cosplayers. Western costumers also include subcultures of hobbyists who participate in \n, \n, and \n. Competition at science fiction conventions typically include the masquerade (where costumes are presented on stage and judged formally) and hall costumes\n (where roving judges may give out awards for outstanding workmanship or presentation).\n\n\nThe increasing popularity of Japanese animation outside of Asia during the late 2000s led to an increase in American and other Western cosplayers who portray manga and anime characters. Anime conventions have become more numerous in the West in the previous decade, now competing with science fiction, comic book and historical conferences in attendance. At these gatherings, cosplayers, like their Japanese counterparts, meet to show off their work, be photographed, and compete in costume contests.\n Convention attendees also just as often dress up as Western comic book or animated characters, or as characters from movies and video games.\n\nDifferences in taste still exist across cultures: some costumes that are worn without hesitation by Japanese cosplayers tend to be avoided by Western cosplayers, such as outfits that \n. Some Western cosplayers have also encountered questions of legitimacy when playing characters of canonically different racial backgrounds,\n and people can be insensitive to cosplayers playing as characters who are canonically of other skin color.\n Western cosplayers of anime characters may also be subjected to particular mockery.\n\n\nIn contrast to Japan, the wearing of costumes in public is more accepted in the UK, Ireland, US, Canada and other western countries. These countries have a longer tradition of \n costumes, fan costuming and other such activities. As a result, for example, costumed convention attendees can often be seen at local restaurants and eateries, beyond the boundaries of the convention or event.\n\n\nJapan is home to two especially popular cosplay magazines, \n (コスモード) and \n' \n (電撃Layers).\n \n has the largest share in the market and an English-language digital edition.\n Another magazine, aimed at a broader, worldwide audience is \n.\n In the United States, \n began publication in February 2015.\n Other magazines include \n featuring cosplayers from all over the world since October 2015,\n and \n which was started in April 2017.\n There are many books on the subject of cosplay as well.\n\n"},

{"title": "March of Return (Israel) - Wikipedia", "content": "The \n (\n: \n, \n) is an annual protest march in Israel organized by the Association for the Defence of the Rights of the Displaced (ADRID), also known as the Committee of the Uprooted,\n which represents the \"\n\", i.e. the \n who are \n. The march takes place annually on or around \n or \n, with a different destination each year – each year one of the \n400 \n is chosen.\n\n\nThe march traces its origins to the early 1980s when hundreds of Palestinian Israelis marched to commemorate their expulsion from \n, gradually institutionalizing the practice of private family visits to destroyed villages.\n The march intersects with the tradition of \n commemoration, following the 1976 land confiscations, which diversified in the 1980s to include organized visits to depopulated villages.\n\n\nThe Committee of the Uprooted first organized a Land Day rally in the depopulated village of \n in 1995. In 1998, they named their annual event a \"March of Return\", beginning a tradition of a mass march to different depopulated villages each year on Nakba Day. The event's secular character, with mixed-gender participation, \n dancing, and secular music, contrasts with the Palestinian Israeli Islamist factions' more reserved attitude. The marches have been unified, peaceful festivals, contrasting with Nakba Day events in the \n that have been marked by confrontations and violence against the \n.\n\n\nThe Committee of the Uprooted orchestrates the marches in conjunction with Israeli authorities, aiming to avoid provocation and maintain positive relations with Israeli Jewish communities. Efforts include discipline in protest expressions, careful route planning to avoid conflicts with Jewish localities, and refraining from marching to certain villages. Jewish participation, including speakers and organizational involvement, has been consistently maintained, though it remains a largely Palestinian-led initiative.\n\n\nThe list below summarizes the destinations of the marches, and where known, the attendance:\n\n"},
{"title": "Arab citizens of Israel - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\n\nThe \n (\n or \n) are the country's largest ethnic minority.\n They are colloquially referred to in \n as either \n (\n \n) or \n (\n \n),\n denoting the fact that they have remained in Israeli territory since the \n was agreed upon between Israel and the \n as part of the \n.\n According to several sources, the majority of \n in \n now prefer to be identified as \n.\n International media outlets often use the term \"Arab-Israeli\" or \"Israeli-Arab\" to distinguish Israel's Arab citizens from the \n residing in the \n.\n They are formerly, or are descended from, those Arabs who belonged to the \n through \n. Speakers of both Arabic and \n, they self-identify in a wide range of intersectional civic (Israeli or \"in Israel\"), national (Arab, Palestinian, Israeli), and religious (\n, \n, \n) identities.\n \n\nFollowing the \n, the Arabs who remained within Israel came under \n, whereas those who were in the \n came under \n. Those who were in the \n did not come under \n and were instead bound by the \n, which had been created by \n during the \n. This three-way split for Palestinian Arabs' citizenship remained in place until the \n, which resulted in Israel's ongoing occupation of the \n. In 1988, \n renounced the 1950 sovereignty claim that it had laid to the \n, effectively rendering over 750,000 of the territory's Palestinian residents stateless. Through the \n of 1980 and the \n of 1981, Israel has granted citizenship eligibility to Palestinians in \n and to \n and other Arabs in the \n; this status has not been extended to non-Jerusalemite Arabs in the West Bank—that is, those who live in what Israel governs as the \n. As a result of the \n in 1988, the stateless Arab residents in the Palestinian territories eventually became recognized as Palestinian citizens and have been issued the \n since 1995.\n\nThe traditional vernacular of most Arab citizens of Israel is \n, including \n in northern Israel, \n in central Israel, and \n across the \n. Because the modern Arabic dialects of Israel's Arabs have absorbed many Hebrew loanwords and phrases, it is sometimes called the \n.\n More recently, there have been reports indicating that Arab Israelis are also increasingly feeling a sense of Israeli identity and are showing a desire for integration and shared future with mainstream Israeli society.\n By religious affiliation, the majority of Arab Israelis are Muslims, but there are significant Christian and Druze minorities, among others.\n\n\nAccording to the \n, the Israeli Arab population stood at 2.1 million people in 2023, accounting for 21% of Israel's total population.\n The majority of these Arab citizens identify themselves as Arab or Palestinian by nationality and as Israeli by citizenship.\n They mostly live in \n, some of which are among the poorest in the country, and generally attend schools that are separated to some degree from those attended by \n.\n Arab political parties traditionally did not join governing coalitions until 2021, when the \n became the first to do so.\n In 2017, a survey reported by \n showed that 60% of Arab Israelis viewed the country favourably, with this figure represented by 49% of Muslim Arabs, 61% of Christian Arabs, and 94% of Druze Arabs.\n The Druze and the \n in the \n and the \n have historically expressed the strongest non-Jewish affinity to Israel and are more likely to identify as \n than other Arab citizens.\n\n\nUnder \n, Arab residents of East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights have the right to become Israeli citizens, are entitled to municipal services, and have municipal voting rights.\n In tandem, citizenship acquisition is scarce: only 5% of Palestinians in East Jerusalem were Israeli citizens in 2022. Originally, the lack of applications for citizenship was largely due to Palestinian society's disapproval of naturalization as \n. After the \n, this taboo began to fade, but the Israeli government re-configured the process to make it more difficult, approving only 34% of new Palestinian applications and giving a plethora of reasons for rejection. Non-citizen Palestinians cannot vote in Israel's legislative elections and must get a \n to travel abroad; many jobs are closed to them and Israel can revoke their residency status, whereby they may lose their health insurance and their right to enter \n.\n\n\nThe choice of terms to refer to Arab citizens of Israel is a highly politicized issue, and there is a broad range of labels that members of this community use to self-identity.\n Generally speaking, supporters of Israel tend to use \n or \n to refer to this population without mentioning Palestine, while critics of Israel (or supporters of Palestinians) tend to use \n or \n without referencing Israel.\n According to \n, most preferred to identify themselves as Palestinian citizens of Israel rather than as Israeli Arabs, as of 2012.\n \n uses both 'Palestinian Israelis'\n and 'Israeli Arabs' to refer to the same population.\n\nThe relationship of Arab citizens to the State of Israel is often fraught with tension and can be regarded in the context of relations between \n populations and state authorities elsewhere in the world.\n Arab citizens consider themselves to be an \n.\n The tension between their Palestinian Arab national identity and their identity as citizens of Israel was famously described by an Arab public figure as: \"My state is at war with my nation\".\n\n\nArab/Palestinian citizens of Israel may refer to themselves by a wide range of terms. Each of these names, while referring to the same group of people, connotes a different balance in what is often a multilayered identity assigning varying levels of priority or emphasis to the various dimensions which may be historic-geographic (\"\n\"), \"national\" or ethnoreligious (Palestinian, Arab, Israeli, Druze, Circassian), linguistic (Arabic-speaking), civic (feeling \"Israeli\" or not), etc.:\n\n\nTwo appellations, among others listed above, are not applied to the \n Arab population or the \n in the \n, as these territories were occupied by Israel in 1967:\n\nAccording to \n, as of 2012, most Israeli Arabs preferred to identify themselves as \n rather than as Israeli Arabs.\n The \n also states that most members of the Israeli Arab community prefer this term.\n The \n asserted in 2021 that \"surveys showed\" that Israeli Arabs preferred the term \"Palestinian citizen of Israel\" and that \"for people who often feel caught between two worlds, however, the contours of what it means to be a Palestinian citizen of Israel remain a work in progress.\"\n \n\nHowever, these findings conflict with a 2017 \n poll which showed most Israelis self-identify as either Arab-Israeli or simply Israeli.\n\n\nSimilar terms that Israeli Arabs, media and other organizations may use are \n and \n. Amnesty reports that “Arab citizens of Israel” is an inclusive term used by Israel that describes a number of different and primarily Arabic-speaking groups, including Muslim Arabs, Christian Arabs, Druze and Circassians. At the end of 2019, considering the number of those defined as Muslim Arabs and Christian Arabs together, the population of Palestinian citizens of Israel amounted to around 1.8 million.\n \n\nThere are at least two terms which specifically exclude the \n Arab population and the \n and other Arabs in the \n: \n, and \n (Arabic: \n, \n).\n These terms clarify that \n\nWhile known officially by the Israeli government only as \"\n\" or \"Arab Israelis\", the development of Palestinian nationalism and identity in the 20th and 21st centuries has been met by a marked evolution in self-identification, reflecting a rising identification with Palestinian identity alongside Arab and Israeli signifiers.\n Many Palestinian citizens of Israel have family ties to Palestinians in the \n and \n as well as to \n in \n, \n and \n.\n\n\nBetween 1948 and 1967, very few Arab citizens of Israel identified openly as \"Palestinian\", and an \"Israeli-Arab\" identity, the preferred phrase of the Israeli establishment and public, was predominant.\n Public expressions of Palestinian identity, such as displays of the \n or the singing and reciting of nationalist songs or poetry were illegal.\n With the end of military administrative rule in 1966 and following the 1967 war, national consciousness and its expression among Israel's Arab citizens spread.\n A majority then self-identified as Palestinian, preferring this descriptor to Israeli Arab in numerous surveys over the years.\n In a 2017 telephone poll, 40% of Arab citizens of Israel identified as \"Arab in Israel / Arab citizen of Israel\", 15% identified as \"Palestinian\", 8.9% as \"Palestinian in Israel / Palestinian citizen of Israel\", and 8.7% as \"Arab\";\n the focus groups associated with the poll provided a different outcome, in which \"there was consensus that Palestinian identity occupies a central place in their consciousness\".\n A November 2023 poll asked respondents from this demographic what the most important \"component in their personal identity\" was to them; 33 percent answered \"Israeli citizenship\", 32 percent \"Arab identity\", 23 percent \"religious affiliation\", and 8 percent \"Palestinian identity\".\n\n\nUniversity of Haifa professor \n commented in 2019, \"The largest now and the most growing identity is a hybrid identity, which is 'Palestinian in Israel' or a similar combination. I think that’s what’s going to take over.\"\n\n\nIn the \n 2022 report \"Israel's Apartheid against Palestinians: Cruel System of Domination and Crime against Humanity\", the organization excludes the Israeli Arab Druze and non-Arab \n from the term Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel: \n\nThe \n included the Druze among the Palestinians.\n The Council of Foreign Relations stated:\"The majority of Arab citizens are Sunni Muslims, though there are many Christians and also Druze, who more often embrace Israeli identity.\"\n\n\nThe question of Palestinian identity extends to representation in the Israeli \n. Journalist Ruth Margalit says of \n of the \n, a member of the \n, \"The traditional term for this group, Arab Israelis, is increasingly controversial, but it's the one that Abbas prefers.\"\n Abbas gave an interview to Israeli media in November 2021 and said  \"My rights don't just come from my citizenship. My rights also come from being a member of the Palestinian people, a son of this Palestinian homeland. And whether we like it or not, the State of Israel, with its identity, was established inside the Palestinian homeland,\"\n \n of \n is \"an outspoken advocate of Palestinian identity\".\n He says, referring to the \n, \"... If the past weeks provided lessons for the international community, then a main one is that they cannot continue to ignore the Palestinian citizens of Israel. Any solution should include full equality for all citizens as well as the respect and recognition of our rights as a national minority.\"\n\n\nSome media using the term \"Palestinian citizens of Israel\" or \"Palestinians in Israel\" have treated the terms as interchangeable with \"Arab citizens of Israel\" or \"Israeli Arabs\", and have not discussed whether Druze and Circassians are exceptions.\n such as the \n.\n \n\nSurveys of Arab-Israeli self-identification are diverse, and have often presented differing if not contradictory results. In 2017 the \n's Program for Jewish-Arab Cooperation at the \n at \n conducted a telephone poll, in which the results were:\n \n\nThe focus groups associated with the poll provided a different outcome, in which \"there was consensus that Palestinian identity occupies a central place in their consciousness\". reflecting \"the strength of Palestinian-Arab identity\", and that they do not see a contradiction between that and Israeli \n identity. The focus group revealed strong opposition to the term \"Israeli-Arab\" and to the concept of Israel's \"Independence Day\". The study concluded that the focus group findings of strong Palestinian national identity, not conflicting with Israeli civic identity, match those seen in the public sphere.\n\n\nAccording to a 2019 survey by \n professor \n, conducted in Arabic among 718 Arab adults, 47% of the Arab population chose Palestinian identities with an Israeli component (\"Israeli Palestinian\", \"Palestinian in Israel\", \"Palestinian Arab in Israel\"), 36% prefers Israeli Arab identities without a Palestinian component (\"Israeli\", \"Arab\", \"Arab in Israel\", \"Israeli Arab\"), and 15% chose Palestinian identities without an Israeli component (\"Palestinian\", \"Palestinian Arab\"). When these two components are presented as competitors, 69% chose exclusive or primary Palestinian identity, compared with 30% who chose exclusive or primary Israeli Arab identity. 66% of the Arab population agreed that \"the identity of 'Palestinian Arab in Israel' is appropriate to most Arabs in Israel.\"\n\n\nAccording to a 2020 survey by \n of \n, 51% of Arabs identify as Arab-Israeli, 7% identify as Palestinian, 23% identify as Israeli, 15% identify as Arab, and 4% identify as \"other.\" This significantly differs from their 2019 survey, in which 49% identified as Arab-Israeli, 18% as Palestinian, 27% as Arab, and 5% as Israeli.\n\n\nCommon practice in contemporary academic literature is to identify this community as \n as it is how the majority self-identify (See \n for more).\n Terms preferred by most Arab citizens to identify themselves include \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n or \n.\n There are, however, individuals from among the Arab citizenry who reject the term \n altogether.\n A minority of Israel's Arab citizens include \"Israeli\" in some way in their self-identifying label; the majority identify as \n by nationality and Israeli by \n.\n\n\nThe Israeli establishment prefers \n or \n, and also uses the terms \n, \n, \n and \n.\n These labels have been criticized for denying this population a political or national identification, obscuring their Palestinian identity and connection to \n.\n The term \n in particular is viewed as a construct of the Israeli authorities.\n It is nonetheless used by a significant minority of the Arab population, \"reflecting its dominance in Israeli social discourse.\"\n\n\nBetween 1920 and 1948, in what was then \n, all citizens were known as Palestinians, and the two primary communities were referred to by the British authorities as \"Arabs\" and \"\n\". Between \n and \n, very few citizens of Israel identified openly as \"Palestinian\". An \"Israeli-Arab\" identity, the preferred phrase of the Israeli establishment and public, was predominant.\n Public expressions of Palestinian identity, such as displays of the \n or the singing and reciting of nationalist songs or poetry were illegal.\n Ever since the 1948 \n, the Palestinians that have remained within the \n have been colloquially known as \"48 Arabs\" (Arabic: \n, \n).\n With the end of military administrative rule in 1966 and following the 1967 war, national consciousness and its expression among Israel's Arab citizens spread.\n A majority then self-identified as Palestinian, preferring this descriptor to Israeli Arab in numerous surveys over the years.\n\n\nArabs in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights (Syrian Golan) are special cases regarding citizenship and identity.\n\nArabs living in \n, occupied and administered by Israel since the Six-Day War of 1967 hold Israeli ID cards, but most are non-citizen permanent residents since few accepted Israel's offer of citizenship after the war's end, refusing to recognize its sovereignty, and most maintain close ties with the West Bank.\n As permanent residents, they are eligible to vote in \n's municipal elections, although only a small percentage takes advantage of this right.\n\nThe Golan Heights was not part of \n or the Ottoman political units which preceded it, but rather was part of Syria, and the UN still recognizes it as such, and calls it the Syrian Golan.\n The remaining \n, occupied and administered by Israel in 1967, are considered permanent residents under Israels \n of 1981. As of mid 2022, 4303 Druze citizens of \n have been granted Israeli citizenship.\n\n\nMost Jewish Israelis refer to the \n as the War of Independence, while most Arab citizens refer to it as \n (the catastrophe), a reflection of differences in perception of the purpose and outcomes of the war.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the 1947–49 war, the territory previously administered by the \n as \n was de facto divided into three parts: the State of Israel, the \n-held West Bank, and the \n-held Gaza Strip. Of the estimated 950,000 Arabs that lived in the territory that became Israel before the war,\n over 80% fled or were expelled. The other 20%, some 156,000, remained.\n Arab citizens of Israel today are largely composed of the people who remained and their descendants. Others include some from the \n and the \n who procured Israeli citizenship under family-unification provisions made significantly more stringent in the aftermath of the \n.\n\n\nArabs who left their homes during the period of armed conflict, but remained in what had become Israeli territory, were considered to be \"\n\". In some cases, they were refused permission to return to their homes, which were \n and turned over to state ownership, as was the property of other \n.\n Some 274,000, or 1 of every 4 Arab citizens of Israel are \"present absentees\" or \n.\n Notable cases of \"present absentees\" include the residents of \n and the \n villages of \n and \n.\n\n\nBetween \n on 14 May 1948 and the Israeli Nationality Law of 14 July 1952, there technically were no Israeli citizens.\n\n\nWhile most Arabs remaining in Israel were granted citizenship, they were subject to martial law in the early years of the state.\n \n had given little serious thought as to how to integrate Arabs, and according to \n subsequent policies were 'implemented by a rigorous regime of military rule that dominated what remained of the Arab population in territory ruled by Israel, enabling the state to expropriate most Arab-owned land, severely limit its access to investment capital and employment opportunity, and eliminate virtually all opportunities to use citizenship as a vehicle for gaining political influence'.\n Travel permits, curfews, \n, and expulsions were part of life until 1966. A variety of Israeli legislative measures facilitated the transfer of land abandoned by Arabs to state ownership. These included the \n which allowed the state to expropriate the property of Palestinians who fled or were expelled to other countries, and the Land Acquisition Law of 1953 which authorized the Ministry of Finance to transfer expropriated land to the state. Other common legal expedients included the use of emergency regulations to declare land belonging to Arab citizens a closed military zone, followed by the use of Ottoman legislation on abandoned land to take control of the land.\n Travel permits, curfews, \n, and expulsions were part of life until 1966.\n\nArabs who held Israeli citizenship were entitled to vote for the Israeli \n. Arab Knesset members have served in office since the \n. The first Arab Knesset members were \n and \n who were members of the \n party and \n, member of the \n party.\n\nIn 1965 a radical independent Arab group called \n forming the Arab Socialist List tried to run for \n elections. The list was banned by the \n.\n\n\nIn 1966, martial law was lifted completely, and the government set about dismantling most of the discriminatory laws, while Arab citizens were granted the same rights as Jewish citizens under law.\n\n\nAfter the 1967 \n, Arab citizens were able to contact Palestinians in the \n and \n for the first time since the establishment of the state. This along with the lifting of military rule, led to increased political activism among Arab citizens.\n\n\nIn 1974, a committee of Arab mayors and municipal councilmen was established which played an important role in representing the community and pressuring the Israeli government.\n This was followed in 1975 by the formation of the Committee for the Defense of the Land, which sought to prevent continuing land expropriations.\n That same year, a political breakthrough took place with the election of Arab poet \n, a \n member, as mayor of Nazareth, accompanied by a strong communist presence in the town council.\n In 1976, six Arab citizens of Israel were killed by Israeli security forces at a protest against land expropriations and house demolitions. The date of the protest, 30 March, has since been commemorated annually as \n.\n\nThe 1980s saw the birth of the \n. As part of a larger trend in the \n, the Islamic Movement emphasized moving Islam into the political realm. The Islamic movement built schools, provided other essential social services, constructed mosques, and encouraged prayer and conservative Islamic dress. The Islamic Movement began to affect electoral politics particularly at the local level.\n\n\nMany Arab citizens supported the \n and assisted Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, providing them with money, food, and clothes. A number of strikes were also held by Arab citizens in solidarity with Palestinians in the occupied territories.\n\n\nThe years leading up to the \n were a time of optimism for Arab citizens. During the administration of \n, Arab parties played an important role in the formation of a governing coalition. Increased participation of Arab citizens was also seen at the civil society level. However, tension continued to exist with many Arabs calling for Israel to become a \"\n\", thereby challenging the state's Jewish identity. In the 1999 elections for prime minister, 94% of the Arab electorate voted for \n. However, Barak formed a broad left-right-center government without consulting the Arab parties, disappointing the Arab community.\n\n\nTensions between Arabs and the state rose in \n when 12 Arab citizens and one man from Gaza were killed while protesting the government's response to the \n. In response to this incident, the government established the \n. The events of October 2000 caused many Arabs to question the nature of their Israeli citizenship. To a large extent, they boycotted the \n as a means of protest.\n This boycott helped Ariel Sharon defeat Ehud Barak; as aforementioned, in the 1999 elections, 94 percent of Israel's Arab minority had voted for Ehud Barak.\n \n enlistment by \n citizens of Israel dropped significantly.\n\n\nDuring the \n, Arab advocacy organizations complained that the Israeli government had invested time and effort to protect Jewish citizens from Hezbollah attacks, but had neglected Arab citizens. They pointed to a dearth of bomb shelters in Arab towns and villages and a lack of basic emergency information in Arabic.\n Many Israeli Jews viewed the Arab opposition to government policy and sympathy with the Lebanese as a sign of disloyalty.\n\n\nIn October 2006, tensions rose when Israeli Prime Minister \n invited a right-wing political party \n, to join his coalition government. The party leader, \n, advocated an ethnicity based territory exchange, the \n, by transferring heavily populated Arab areas (mainly \n), to Palestinian Authority control and annexing major Jewish Israeli settlement blocs in the West Bank close to the green line as part of a peace proposal.\n Arabs who would prefer to remain in Israel instead of becoming citizens of a Palestinian state would be able to move to Israel. All citizens of Israel, whether Jews or Arabs, would be required to pledge an oath of allegiance to retain citizenship. Those who refuse could remain in Israel as permanent residents.\n\n\nIn January 2007 the first non-Druze Arab minister in Israel's history, \n, was appointed \n (\n, a \n, had been appointed a minister without portfolio in 2001). The appointment was criticized by the left, which felt it was an attempt to cover up the Labor Party's decision to sit with Yisrael Beiteinu in the government, and by the right, who saw it as a threat to Israel's status as a \n.\n\n\nDuring the \n widespread protests and riots intensified across Israel, particularly in cities with large Arab populations. In Lod, rocks were thrown at Jewish apartments and some Jewish residents were evacuated from their homes by the police. Synagogues and a Muslim cemetery were vandalized.\n Communal violence including \"riots, stabbings, arson, attempted home invasions and shootings\" was reported from Beersheba, Rahat, Ramla, Lod, Nasiriyah, Tiberias, Jerusalem, Haifa and Acre.\n\n\nSince the outbreak of the \n, Israel has carried out \n of Palestinian workers and Arab citizens of Israel.\n On 5 November 2023, \n reported that \"dozens\" of Palestinian residents and Arab Israelis were arrested in Israel for expressions of solidarity with the civilian population of Gaza, sharing \n verses, or expressing \"any support for the Palestinian people\".\n \n described the widespread targeting of Arab Israelis by Israeli security forces.\n Referring to \"hundreds\" of interrogations, \n reported on 11 November that Israel increasingly treats its Arab minority as a \"potential \n\".\n At the same time, the conflict saw an increased self-identification with Israel among Arab citizens.\n According to different polls, a majority of Israeli Arabs condemned the \n, but also opposed the mass bombardement of Gaza. Many Israeli Arabs expressed a general resentment over the war, as other Palestinians regarded them as supporters of Israel, whereas Israeli Jews saw them as potential \n supporters.\n\n\nIn 2006, the official number of Arab residents in Israel – including East Jerusalem and Golan Heights permanent residents many of whom are not citizens – was 1,413,500 people, about 20% of Israel's population.\n The Arab population in 2023 was estimated at 2,065,000, representing 21% of the country's population.\n According to the \n (May 2003), Muslims, including Bedouins, make up 82% of the entire Arab population in Israel, along with around 9% Druze, and 9% Christians.\n Projections based on 2010 data, predicted that Arab Israelis will constitute 25% of Israel's population by 2025.\n\n\nThe national language and mother tongue of Arab citizens, including the Druze, is \n and the colloquial spoken language is of the \n dialect. Knowledge and command of \n varies.\n\n\nMuslims comprise 17.9% of the Israeli population in 2019.\n The majority of Muslims in Israel are \n,\n with an \n minority.\n There are around 4,000 \n in Israel and the majority of them live in \n village in the occupied \n near the border with \n. The \n are also Arab Muslims, with some Bedouin clans participating in the \n. The small \n community is composed of Sunni Muslims uprooted from the \n in the late 19th century. In addition, smaller populations of \n, \n and \n Muslims also live in Israel.\n\nIn 2020; \n had the largest number of Muslim residents (346,000) in Israel, who comprise 21.1% of the Muslim population in Israel, and around 36.9% of the city's residents. \n, had the second largest number of Muslim residents (71,300) in Israel, while \n and \n had around 56,000 and 55,600 residents, respectively.\n The eleven towns of the \n are home to approximately 250,000 Israeli Muslims.\n\n\nIn 2020; approximately 35.2% of the Israeli Muslim population lived in the \n, 21.9% in the \n, 17.1% in the \n, 13.7% in the \n, 10.9% in the \n, and 1.2% lived in the \n.\n The Israeli Muslim population is young: around 33.4% of the Muslim population in Israel are of people aged 14 and under, while the percentage of people aged 65 and over is 4.3%, and the Muslim population in Israel had the highest \n (3.16) compared with other religious communities.\n\n\nAccording to study published by \n in 2016, while Muslims living in Israel, overall, are more religious than Israeli Jews, they are less religious than Muslims living in many other countries in the Middle East. Muslim women are more likely to say that religion has high importance in their lives, and younger Muslims are generally less observant than their elders.\n According to the \n survey conducted in 2015, 47% of Israeli Muslims identified as traditional, 32% identified as religious, 17% identified as not religious at all, 3% identified as very religious.\n\n\nTraditionally settled communities of \n Arabs comprise about 70% of the Arab population in Israel. In 2010, the average number of children per mother was 3.84, dropping from 3.97 in 2008. The Muslim population is mostly young: 42% of Muslims are under the age of 15. The median age of Muslim Israelis is 18, while the median age of Jewish Israelis is 30. The percentage of people over 65 is less than 3% for Muslims, compared with 12% for the Jewish population.\n\n\nAccording to the \n, 110,000 Bedouins live in the \n, 50,000 in the \n, and 10,000 in the central region of Israel.\n Prior to the establishment of Israel in 1948, there were an estimated 65,000–90,000 Bedouin living in the Negev.\n The 11,000 who remained were relocated by the Israeli government in the 1950s and 1960s to an area in the northeastern Negev comprising 10% of the Negev desert.\n The Israeli government built seven development towns for the Bedouin between 1979 and 1982. Around half the Bedouin population live in these towns, the largest of which is the city of \n, others being \n (Ar'ara BaNegev), \n, \n, \n, \n, \n (Segev Shalom) and \n (Tel Sheva).\n\nApproximately 40–50% of Bedouin citizens of Israel live in 39–45 \n that are not connected to the electrical grid and water mains.\n A study published by the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in 2017 found that Bedouins has the lowest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices: \n scores, rates of \n, and fields of employment. As they tend to be the least educated.\n\n\nMost Israeli \n live in the north of the country and are recognised as a separate community to Arabs. The Galilean Druze and Druze of the \n region received Israeli citizenship automatically in 1948. After Israel captured the \n from Syria in 1967 and annexed it to Israel in 1981, the \n were offered full Israeli citizenship under the \n. Most declined Israeli citizenship and retain \n citizenship and identity and are treated as permanent residents of Israel.\n\n\nAt the end of 2019, approximately 81% of the Israeli Druze population lived in the \n and 19% lived in the \n, and the largest population of Druze were \n and \n. Israeli Druze live in 19 towns and villages, either singly or mixed with Christians and Muslims, all located on the tops of the mountains in northern Israel (\n and \n and \n), including \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n There are four remaining Druze villages in the Israeli-annexed portion of the \n—\n, \n, \n, and \n—in which 23,000 Druze live.\n\n\nDuring the \n, the Druze did not embrace the rising \n of the time or participate in violent confrontations. In 1948, many Druze volunteered for the Israeli army and no Druze villages were destroyed or permanently abandoned.\n Since the establishment of the state, the Druze have demonstrated solidarity with Israel and distanced themselves from Arab and Islamic radicalism.\n Druze citizens serve in the \n.\n\n\nFrom 1957, the Israeli government formally recognized the Druze as a separate religious community,\n and are defined as a distinct ethnic group in the \n census registration. While the Israeli education system is basically divided into Hebrew and Arabic speaking schools, the Druze have autonomy within the Arabic speaking branch.\n Israeli Druze are Arabic in language and \n,\n and their mother tongue is the \n.\n\nIn a survey conducted in 2008 by Dr. Yusuf Hassan of \n 94% of Druze respondents identified as \"Druze-Israelis\" in the religious and national context,\n while a 2017 Pew Research Center poll reported that while 99% of Muslims and 96% of Christians identified as ethnically Arab, a smaller share of Druze, 71%, identified likewise.\n Compared to other Christians and Muslims, Druze place less emphasis on \n and self-identify more as Israeli. Most do not identify as \n.\n Druze politicians in Israel include \n, who represented \n in the \n; \n of \n, the Deputy Speaker of the Knesset; and \n of the Arab party \n.\n\n\nChristian Arabs comprise about 9% of the Arab population in Israel. At the end of 2019, approximately 70.6% reside in the \n, 13.3% in the \n, 9.5% in the \n, 3.4% in the \n, 2.7% in the \n and 0.5% in the \n.\n There are 135,000 or more Christian Arabs in Israel (and more than 39,000 non-Arab Christians).\n As of 2014 the \n was the largest Christian community in Israel, where about 60% of \n belonged to the Melkite Greek Catholic Church,\n while around 30% of Israeli Christians belonged to the \n.\n The Christian communities in Israel run numerous \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, homes for the elderly, \n, family and youth centers, \n, and guesthouses.\n\n\n has the largest Christian Arab population, followed by \n.\n The majority of Haifa's Arab minority is Christian as well.\n The Christian Arab communities in Nazareth and Haifa tend to be wealthier and better educated compare to other Arabs elsewhere in Israel.\n Arab Christians also live in a number of other localities in the \n; such as \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\n localities such as \n, \n, \n and \n are predominantly Christians.\n Nearly all the population of \n and \n are \n \n.\n Some Druze villages, such as \n,\n \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n have small Christian Arab populations.\n Mixed cities such as \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n-\n have significant Christian Arab populations.\n\n\nMany Christian Arabs have been prominent in Arab political parties in Israel, and leaders have included Archbishop \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n. Notable Christian religious figures include the \n Archbishops of the Galilee \n and \n, the \n \n, and Bishop \n of the Lutheran Church of Jordan and the Holy Land. Israeli Supreme Court judges \n and \n are Christian Arab.\n Notable Christian figures in science and high tech include \n who has many contributions in multidisciplinary fields such as \n, \n and \n,\n and \n who is \n's \n of \n \n.\n\n\nAmong Arab Christians in Israel, some emphasize \n, whilst a small minority enlists in the \n.\n Since September 2014 Christian families or clans who have either Aramaic or Maronite cultural heritage are considered an ethnicity separate from \n and can register themselves as Arameans. This recognition comes after about seven years of activity by the Aramean Christian Foundation in Israel, which rather than sticking to an Arab identity, wishes to assimilate into an Israeli lifestyle. Aram is led by IDF Major Shadi Khalloul Risho and the Israeli Christian Recruitment Forum, headed by \n of the Greek-Orthodox Church and Major Ihab Shlayan.\n The move was condemned by the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate, which described it as an attempt to divide the Palestinian minority in Israel.\n Other pro-Zionist advocates supporting similar ideas received extensive coverage in Israeli state sponsored media and Jewish news outlets to severe criticisms from their co-religionists (see \n).   \n\n are one of the most educated groups in Israel.\n Statistically, \n in Israel have the highest rates of \n among all religious communities, according to a data by \n in 2010, 63% of Israeli \n have had college or \n, the highest of any religious and \n group.\n Despite the fact that Arab Christians only represent 2% of the total Israeli population, in 2014 they accounted for 17% of the country's \n students, and for 14% of its \n students.\n There are more \n who have attained a \n or higher \n than the median Israeli population.\n The rate of students studying in the field of \n was higher among \n Arab students than that of all other sectors,\n and the percentage of \n women who are receiving higher education is also higher than that of other groups.\n\n\nThe \n noted that when taking into account the data recorded over the years, Israeli \n fared the best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.\n In 2012 Christian Arabs had the highest rates of success at \n,\n In 2016, Arab Christians had the highest rates of success at \n, namely 73.9%, both in comparison to Muslim and \n Israelis (41% and 51.9% respectively), and to the students from the different branches of the \n (majority \n) education system considered as one group (55.1%).\n\n\nIn terms of their socio-economic situation, \n are more similar to the Jewish population than to the Muslim Arab population.\n They have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment, at 4.9%, compared to 6.5% among Jewish men and women.\n They have also the highest \n among Arab citizens of Israel and second highest median household income among the Israeli ethno-religious groups.\n Also Arab Christians have a high presentation in \n and in the \n professions.\n In Israel Arab Christians are portrayed as a hard working and \n educated \n minority. According to study the majority of Christians in Israel (68.2 per cent) are employed in the service sector, i.e. banks, insurance companies, schools, tourism, hospitals etc.\n\n\nAccording to the study \"Are Christian Arabs the New Israeli Jews? Reflections on the Educational Level of Arab Christians in Israel\" by Hanna David from the \n, one of the factors why \n are the most educated segment of Israel's population is the high level of the Christian educational institutions. \n in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from \n,\n and about 87% of the Israeli Arabs in the \n sector have been educated in Christian schools.\n A 2011 Maariv article described the Christian Arab sector as \"the most successful in the education system\",\n an opinion supported by the \n and others who point out that Christian Arabs fared best in terms of education in comparison to any other group receiving an education in Israel.\n\n\nThere are 3,500 \n,\n most of them are former members of the \n (SLA) and their families. The SLA was a Christian-dominated militia allied with the \n during the \n until Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon in May 2000 that ended the \n.\n The majority are \n but there are also Muslims, Druze and Christians of other denominations among them.\n They are registered by the \n as \"Lebanese\" and hold \n.\n They are located across the country, mainly in the \n, in cities such as \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n\n\nThe native language of former SLA members is \n. However, the language is only partially transmitted from one generation to another. The majority of the second generation understand and speak Lebanese Arabic but are unable to read and write it. Young Lebanese Israeli mainly \n in Hebrew or, more rarely, in Lebanese Arabic written in the \n. Religious books for children and youths are similarly written in \n (or in Lebanese Arabic for some songs) in Hebrew letters.\n\n\nIn 2006, the official number of Arab residents in Israel was 1,413,500 people, about 20% of Israel's population. This figure includes 209,000 Arabs (14% of the Israeli Arab population) in East Jerusalem, also counted in the Palestinian statistics, although 98% of East Jerusalem Palestinians have either Israeli residency or Israeli citizenship.\n In 2012, the official number of Arab residents in Israel increased to 1,617,000 people, about 21% of Israel's population.\n The Arab population in 2023 was estimated at 2,065,000 people, representing 21% of the country's population.\n\n\nAccording to the Israeli \n census in 2010, \"the Arab population lives in 134 towns and villages. About 44 percent of them live in towns (compared to 81 percent of the Jewish population); 48 percent live in villages with local councils (compared to 9 percent of the Jewish population). Four percent of the Arab citizens live in small villages with regional councils, while the rest live in unrecognized villages (the proportion is much higher, 31 percent in the Negev)\".\n The Arab population in Israel is located in five main areas: \n (54.6% of total Israeli Arabs), \n (23.5% of total Israeli Arabs), \n, \n, and Northern \n (13.5% of total Israeli Arabs).\n Around 8.4% (approximately 102,000 inhabitants) of Israeli Arabs live in officially mixed Jewish-Arab cities (excluding Arab residents in East Jerusalem), including \n, \n, \n, \n-\n, \n, \n, and \n.\n\n\nIn Israel's \n Arab citizens of Israel form a majority of the population (52%) and about 50% of the Arab population lives in 114 different localities throughout Israel.\n In total there are 122 primarily if not entirely \n, 89 of them having populations over two thousand.\n The seven townships as well as the \n that have been constructed by the government for the Bedouin population of the Negev,\n are the only Arab localities to have been established since 1948, with the aim of relocating the Arab Bedouin citizens (\n).\n\n\n46% of the country's Arabs (622,400 people) live in predominantly Arab communities in the north.\n In 2022 \n was the largest Arab city, with a population of 78,007,\n roughly 40,000 of whom are Muslim. \n has a population of approximately 43,543 and the city is mixed with sizable populations of Muslims, Christians, and Druze.\n\n, a mixed city, has the largest overall Arab population. Jerusalem housed 332,400 Arabs in 2016 (37.7% of the city's residents)\n and together with the local council of \n, some 19% of the country's entire Arab population.\n\n14% of Arab citizens live in the \n predominantly in the \n region. Here is the largest Muslim city, \n, with a population of 58,665. \n is the second largest Arab population center in the district. The city of \n has an Arab population of 10%, much of it in the \n, Abbas and Halissa neighborhoods.\n \n and Abbas neighborhoods, are largely \n,\n Halisa and \n are largely \n.\n\n\n10% of the country's Arab population resides in the \n of Israel, primarily the cities of \n, \n, and \n as well as the mixed cities of \n and \n which have mainly Jewish populations.\n\n\nOf the remaining 11%, 10% live in Bedouin communities in the northwestern \n. The Bedouin city of \n is the only Arab city in the \n and it is the third largest Arab city in Israel.\n\nThe remaining 1% of the country's Arab population lives in cities that are almost entirely Jewish, such as \n with an Arab population of 22%\n and \n, 4%.\n\n\nIn February 2008, the government announced that the first new Arab city would be constructed in Israel. According to \n, \"[s]ince the establishment of the State of Israel, not a single new Arab settlement has been established, with the exception of permanent housing projects for Bedouins in the Negev\".\n The city, Givat Tantur, was never constructed even after 10 years.\n\n\nArabs make up the majority of the population of the \"heart of the \n\" and of the areas along the \n including the \n region. Bedouin Arabs make up the majority of the northeastern section of the \n.\n\nThe phrase \n (or \n) is used within the \n to describe the growth of Israel's Arab citizenry as constituting a threat to its maintenance of its status as a \n with a Jewish demographic majority. In the northern part of Israel the percentage of the population that is Jewish is declining.\n The increasing population of Arabs within Israel, and the majority status they hold in two major geographic regions – the Galilee and the \n – has become a growing point of open political contention in recent years. Among Arabs, Muslims have the highest birth rate, followed by Druze, and then Christians.\n\nIsraeli historian \n stated in 2004 that, while he strongly opposes expulsion of Israeli Arabs, in case of an \"apocalyptic\" scenario where Israel comes under total attack with \n and comes under existential threat, an expulsion might be the only option. He compared the Israeli Arabs to a \"time bomb\" and \"a potential \n\" in both demographic and security terms and said they are liable to undermine the state in time of war.\n\n\nSeveral politicians\n have viewed the Arabs in Israel as a security and demographic threat.\n\n\nThe phrase \"demographic bomb\" was famously used by Benjamin Netanyahu in 2003\n when he noted that, if the percentage of Arab citizens rises above its current level of about 20 percent, Israel will not be able to maintain a Jewish demographic majority. Netanyahu's comments were criticized as \n by Arab Knesset members and a range of civil rights and human rights organizations, such as the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.\n Even earlier allusions to the \"demographic threat\" can be found in an internal Israeli government document drafted in 1976 known as the \n, which laid out a plan for reducing the number and influence of Arab citizens of Israel in the \n region.\n\nIn 2003, the Israeli daily \n published an article entitled \"Special Report: Polygamy is a Security Threat\", detailing a report put forth by the Director of the Population Administration at the time, Herzl Gedj; the report described \n in the Bedouin sector a \"security threat\" and advocated means of reducing the birth rate in the Arab sector.\n The Population Administration is a department of the Demographic Council, whose purpose, according to the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, is: \"...to increase the Jewish birthrate by encouraging women to have more children using government grants, housing benefits, and other incentives\".\n In 2008 the minister of the interior appointed Yaakov Ganot as new head of the Population Administration, which according to \n is \"probably the most important appointment an interior minister can make\".\n\n\nA January 2006 study rejects the \"demographic time bomb\" threat based on statistical data that shows Jewish births have increased while Arab births have begun to drop.\n The study noted shortcomings in earlier demographic predictions (for example, in the 1960s, predictions suggested that Arabs would be the majority in 1990). The study also demonstrated that Christian Arab and Druze birth rates were actually below those of Jewish birth rates in Israel. The study used data from a Gallup poll to demonstrate that the desired family size for Arabs in Israel and Jewish Israelis were the same. The study's population forecast for 2025 predicted that Arabs would comprise only 25% of the Israeli population. Nevertheless, the Bedouin population, with its high birth rates, continues to be perceived as a threat to a Jewish demographic majority in the south, and a number of development plans, such as the \n, address this concern.\n\n\nA study showed that in 2010, Jewish birthrates rose by 31% and 19,000 diaspora Jews immigrated to Israel, while the Arab birthrate fell by 2%.\n\n\nSome Israeli politicians advocate land-swap proposals in order to assure a continued Jewish majority within Israel. A specific proposal is that Israel transfer sovereignty of part of the Arab-populated \n area (west of the \n) to a future Palestinian state, in return for formal sovereignty over the major Jewish settlement \"blocks\" that lie inside the \n east of the Green Line.\n\n\n of \n, the fourth largest faction in the 17th Knesset, is one of the foremost advocates of the transfer of large Arab towns located just inside Israel near the border with the \n (e.g. \n, \n, \n), to the jurisdiction of the \n in exchange for \n located inside the \n.\n\n\nIn October 2006, \n formally joined in the ruling government's parliamentary coalition, headed by \n. After the \n confirmed Avigdor Lieberman's appointment to the position of \"minister for strategic threats\", Labour Party representative and science, sport and culture minister \n resigned his post.\n In his resignation letter to Ehud Olmert, Pines-Paz wrote: \"I couldn't sit in a government with a minister who preaches racism.\"\n\n\nThe \n caused a stir among Arab citizens of Israel. Various polls show that Arabs in Israel do not wish to move to the West Bank or Gaza if a Palestinian state is created there.\n In a survey conducted by Kul Al-Arab among 1,000 residents of Um Al-Fahm, 83 percent of respondents opposed the idea of transferring their city to Palestinian jurisdiction, while 11 percent supported the proposal and 6 percent did not express their position.\n\n\nOf those opposed to the idea, 54% said that they were against becoming part of a \n because they wanted to continue living under a democratic regime and enjoying a good standard of living. Of these opponents, 18% said that they were satisfied with their present situation, that they were born in Israel and that they were not interested in moving to any other state. Another 14% of this same group said that they were not prepared to make sacrifices for the sake of the creation of a Palestinian state. Another 11 percent cited no reason for their opposition.\n\n\nThere are three mainstream Arab parties in Israel: \n (a joint Arab-Jewish party with a large Arab presence), \n, and the \n, which is a coalition of several different political organizations including the \n. In addition to these, there is \n, which currently run with Hadash. All of these parties primarily represent Arab-Israeli and Palestinian interests, and the Islamic Movement is an \n organization with two factions: one that opposes Israel's existence, and another that opposes its existence as a Jewish state. Two Arab parties ran in Israel's \n, with one, the \n, winning two seats. Until the 1960s all Arab parties in the Knesset were aligned with \n, the ruling party.\n\nA minority of Arabs join and vote for \n parties; in the \n 30% of the Arab vote went to such parties, up from 25% in \n,\n though down on the \n (31%) and \n (33%).\n Left-wing parties (i.e. \n and \n, and previously \n) are the most popular parties amongst Arabs, though some Druze have also voted for right-wing parties such as \n and \n, as well as the centrist \n.\n\n\nArab-dominated parties typically do not join governing coalitions. However, historically these parties have formed alliances with dovish Israeli parties and promoted the formation of their governments by voting with them from the opposition. Arab parties are credited with keeping Prime Minister \n in power, and they have suggested they would do the same for a government led by Labor leader \n and peace negotiator \n.\n A 2015 \n poll found that a majority of Israeli Arabs would like their parties, then running on a \n, to join the governing coalition.\n\n\nPalestinian Arabs sat in the state's \n in 1949. In 2011, 13 of the 120 members of the \n are Arab citizens, most representing Arab political parties, and one of Israel's \n judges is a Palestinian Arab.\n\n\nThe 2015 elections included 18 Arab members of Knesset. Along with 13 members of the \n, there were five Arab parliamentarians representing Zionist parties, which is more than double their number in the previous Knesset.\n\n\nSome Arab Members of the Knesset, past and present, are under police investigation for their visits to countries designated as enemy countries by Israeli law. This law was amended following MK Mohammad Barakeh's trip to Syria in 2001, such that MKs must explicitly request permission to visit these countries from the Minister of the Interior. In August 2006, Balad MKs \n, \n, and \n visited \n without requesting nor receiving such permission, and a criminal investigation of their actions was launched. Former Arab Member of Knesset \n was questioned 18 September 2006 by police on suspicion of having entered a designated enemy country without official permission. He was questioned \"under caution\" for 2.5 hours in the \n station about his recent visit to Syria. Another former Arab Member of Knesset, \n, was also summoned for police questioning regarding the same trip.\n In 2010, six Arab MKs visited \n, an openly anti-Zionist Arab state, and met with \n and various senior government officials. Gaddafi urged them to seek a \n, and for Arabs to \"multiply\" in order to counter any \"plots\" to expel them.\n\n\nAccording to a study commissioned by the Arab Association of Human Rights entitled \"Silencing Dissent\", over the period 1999–2002, eight of nine of the then Arab Knesset members were beaten by Israeli forces during demonstrations.\n Most recently according to the report, legislation has been passed, including three election laws [e.g., banning political parties], and two Knesset related laws aimed to \"significantly curb the minority [Arab population] right to choose a public representative and for those representatives to develop independent political platforms and carry out their duties\".\n\n\nThe Knesset Ethics Committee has on several occasions banned Arab MKs that the committee felt were acting outside acceptable norms. In 2016, \n and \n were banned from plenary sessions for four months and \n for two months after they had visited families of Palestinian attackers killed by Israeli security forces.\n Ghattas was again banned for six months in 2017 over charges of having smuggled cell phones to Palestinian prisoners\n and Zoabi was banned for a week for having called IDF soldiers \"murderers.\"\n\n\nIn 2016, the Knesset passed a controversial law that would allow it to impeach any MK who incites racism or supports armed struggle against Israel. Critics said that the law was undemocratic and would mainly be used to silence Arab MKs.\n As of 2020, no MK has been impeached by the law.\n In 2018, the Israeli supreme court of justice rejected arguments that the law would harm specific political parties and ruled that checks and balances within the law serve as sufficient protection against abuse of rights. For example, the law requires 70 Knesset members, 10 of whom must be from the opposition, to petition to the Knesset House Committee, and could only be finalized with a vote of 90 out of 120 MKs in favor of the impeachment.\n\n\nIn the public employment sphere, by the end of 2002, 6% of 56,362 Israeli civil servants were Arab.\n In January 2004, Prime Minister \n declared that every state-run company must have at least one Arab citizen of Israel on its board of directors.\n\n\n\nArab citizens of Israel have been \n, and \n held 17 of its 120 seats. The first female Arab MP was \n, a Muslim Arab from central Israel, who was elected in 1999.\n\n\n Until 2001, no Arab had been included Israel's cabinet. In 2001, this changed, when \n, a Druze Arab citizen of Israel, was appointed a member of \n's cabinet without a portfolio. Tarif was later ejected after being convicted of corruption.\n The first non-Druze Arab minister in Israel's history was Raleb Majadele, who in 2007 was appointed a minister without portfolio, and a month later appointed minister for Science, Culture and Sport.\n Following this precedent, additional Muslim Arabs served as ministers or deputy ministers, including \n, \n and \n\n\nThe appointment of Majadele was criticized by far-right Israelis, some of whom are also within the Cabinet, but this drew condemnation across the mainstream Israeli political spectrum.\n Meanwhile, Arab lawmakers called the appointment an attempt to \"whitewash Israel's discriminatory policies against its Arab minority\".\n\n\n\n\n, a Muslim from northern Israel, was the first Arab on the Israeli Supreme Court, serving a 9-month term in 1999. In 2004, \n, a Christian Arab from \n descended from Lebanese Maronites, became the first Arab to hold a permanent appointment on the Court. Joubran's expertise lies in the field of \n.\n \n, a Christian Arab from \n has served as a Tel Aviv District Court judge since 2000. He was the presiding judge in the trial of \n. In 2011, he was nominated as a candidate for the \n.\n\n\n\n\n, an Arab Muslim, became the first Arab ambassador for Israel in 1995 when he was appointed ambassador to \n. He served until 1999, and in 2006 was appointed ambassador to \n. Other Arab ambassadors include \n, a Druze, appointed ambassador to \n in 1999, and \n, also a Druze, a former ambassador to \n. \n, an Arab Muslim, was Consul-General in \n. In 2006, \n was appointed Israeli consul in San Francisco, becoming the first Bedouin consul of the State of Israel.\n\n\n\nArab Generals in the IDF include Major General Hussain Fares, commander of Israel's border police, and Major General \n, head of the \n and current \n.\n Both are members of the \n community. Other high-ranking officers in the IDF include Lieutenant Colonel \n (born Abd el-Majid Haydar/ عبد الماجد حيدر) from the Bedouin community, a legendary officer in the Israel Defense Forces and one of six Israeli Arabs to have received the IDF's third highest decoration, the \n.\n\n\nIn 2011, Jamal Hakroush became the first Muslim Arab deputy Inspector-General in the \n. He has previously served as district commander of two districts.\n\n\n\nIn 2007, Ra'adi Sfori became the first Arab citizen of Israel to be elected as a JNF director, over a petition against his appointment. The court upheld the JNF's appointment, explaining, \"As this is one director among a large number, there is no chance he will have the opportunity to cancel the organization's goals.\"\n\n\n is a political movement that grew out of organizing by Arab university youth, beginning in 1969.\n It is not affiliated with the Arab Knesset party Balad. While participating in municipal elections, Abnaa al-Balad firmly reject any participation in the Israeli Knesset. Political demands include \"the return of all Palestinian refugees to their homes and lands, [an] end [to] the Israeli occupation and Zionist apartheid and the establishment [of] a democratic secular state in Palestine as the ultimate solution to the Arab-Zionist conflict.\"\n\n\nThe \n is an extra-parliamentary umbrella organization that represents Arab citizens of Israel at the national level.\n It is \"the top representative body deliberating matters of general concern to the entire Arab community and making binding decisions.\"\n While it enjoys \n recognition from the \n, it lacks official or \n recognition from the state for its activities in this capacity.\n\n\n is \"a grassroots movement of Arabs and Jews working to break down the walls of racism and segregation by constructing a true Arab-Jewish partnership.\"\n\n\nThe \n is a body of unofficial representatives of the \n throughout the \n region in the south.\n\nAmendment 9 to the 'Basic Law: The Knesset and the Law of Political Parties' states that a political party \"may not participate in the elections if there is in its goals or actions a denial of the existence of the State of Israel as the state of the Jewish people, a denial of the democratic nature of the state, or incitement to racism.\"\n There have been a number of attempts to disqualify Arab parties based on this rule, however as of 2010, all such attempts were either rejected by the Israeli Central Elections Committee or overturned by the Israeli Supreme Court.\n\nAn \n ruling which allowed the \n to run for the Knesset in 1988 was challenged based on this amendment, but the committee's decision was upheld by the Israeli Supreme Court, which ruled that the PLP's platform calling for Israel to become \"a state of all its citizens\" does not violate the ideology of Israel as the State of the Jewish people, and thus section 7(a) does not apply.\n\n\nIn December 2002, \n and his party, \n, which calls for Israel to become \"a state of all its citizens\", were banned by the \n, for refusing to recognize Israel as a \"\n\"\n and making statements promoting armed struggle against it. The Supreme Court overruled the decision in January 2003.\n Bishara served as a Knesset member from 1996 to 2007. He reportedly told an audience in Lebanon in December 2005 that Arab citizens \"... are like all Arabs, only with Israeli citizenship forced upon them ... Return Palestine to us and take your democracy with you. We Arabs are not interested in it\".\n Bishara resigned his Knesset office and left the country in 2007 amidst news that criminal charges were being laid against him. He has been charged with espionage and money laundering, stemming from allegations that he gave \n information on strategic targets that should be attacked with rockets during the \n, in exchange for large amounts of money.\n\n\nIn 2009, United Arab List – Ta'al and Balad were disqualified, on grounds that they do not recognize the State of Israel and call for armed conflict against it.\n The Supreme Court overturned the committee's decision by a majority of eight to one.\n\n\n called for the establishment of a Jewish state with equality of social and political rights, irrespective of religion, race, or sex.\n\n\nThe rights of citizens are guaranteed by a set of \n (Israel does not have a written constitution).\n Although this set of laws does not explicitly include the term \"right to equality\", the Israeli Supreme Court has consistently interpreted \"Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty\"\n and \"Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation (1994)\"\n as guaranteeing equal rights for all Israeli citizens.\n\n\nThe Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that \"Arab Israelis are citizens of Israel with equal rights\" and states that \"The only legal distinction between Arab and Jewish citizens is not one of rights, but rather of civic duty. Since Israel's establishment, Arab citizens have been exempted from compulsory service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\"\n Druze and \n are drafted into the Israeli army, while other Arabs may serve voluntarily; however, only a very small number of Arabs choose to volunteer for the Israeli army.\n\n\nMany Arab citizens feel that the state, as well as society at large, not only actively limits them to second-class citizenship, but treats them as enemies, affecting their perception of the \n versus \n quality of their citizenship.\n The joint document \n, asserts: \"Defining the Israeli State as a Jewish State and exploiting democracy in the service of its Jewishness excludes us, and creates tension between us and the nature and essence of the State.\" The document explains that by definition the \"Jewish State\" concept is based on ethnically preferential treatment towards Jews enshrined in immigration (the \n) and land policy (the \n), and calls for the establishment of minority rights protections enforced by an independent anti-discrimination commission.\n\n\nA 2004 report by \n, an advocacy center for Palestinian-Arab citizens of Israel, states that since the events of \n, 16 Arabs had been killed by security forces, bringing the total to 29 victims of \"institutional violence\" in four years.\n Ahmed Sa'adi, in his article on \n, states that since 1948 the only protestors to be killed by the police have been Arabs.\n\n\n, an Israeli citizen and the executive director of \n, wrote that Palestinians only have varying degrees of limited rights in Israel. He states that although Palestinians make up about 20% of Israel's population, less than 7% of the budget is allocated to Palestinian citizens. He describes the 1.5 million Arab citizens of Israel as second-class citizens while four million more are not citizens at all. He states that a Jew from any country can move to Israel but a Palestinian refugee, with a valid claim to property in Israel, cannot. Munayyer also described the difficulties he and his wife faced when visiting the country.\n\n\n was until July 2018 one of Israel's official languages.\n The use of Arabic increased significantly following \n rulings in the 1990s. \n defines Hebrew as the official language of the State and gives the Arabic language a special status.\n\nGovernment ministries publish all material intended for the public in Hebrew, with selected material translated into Arabic, English, Russian, and other languages spoken in Israel. There are laws that secure the Arab population's right to receive information in Arabic. Some examples include a portion of the public television channels' productions must be in Arabic or translated into Arabic, safety regulations in working places must be published in Arabic if a significant number of the workers are Arabs, information about medicines or dangerous chemicals must be provided in Arabic, and information regarding elections must be provided in Arabic. The country's laws are published in Hebrew, and eventually English and Arabic translations are published.\n Publishing the law in Hebrew in the \n (\n) is enough to make it valid. Unavailability of an Arabic translation can be regarded as a legal defense only if the defendant proves he could not understand the meaning of the law in any conceivable way. Following appeals to the Israeli Supreme Court, the use of Arabic on street signs and labels increased dramatically. In response to one of the appeals presented by Arab Israeli organizations,\n the Supreme Court ruled that although second to Hebrew, Arabic is an official language of the State of Israel, and should be used extensively. Today most highway signage is trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic, and English).\n\nMany Arab villages lack street signs of any kind and the Hebrew name is often used.\n The state's schools in Arab communities teach in Arabic according to a specially adapted curriculum. This curriculum includes mandatory lessons of Hebrew as foreign language from the 3rd grade onwards. Arabic is taught in Hebrew-speaking schools, but only the basic level is mandatory. In the summer of 2008, there was an unsuccessful attempt of right-wing lawmakers to strip Arabic of its status alongside Hebrew as an official language of the state.\n\n\nSome Arab politicians have requested a reevaluation of the \n and \n, arguing that the \n at the flag's center is an exclusively Jewish symbol, and \n does not represent Arab citizens, since it speaks of the Jewish people's desire to return to their homeland. The \n and the \n in Israel stated in 2006,\n\n\nThe Israeli legal system includes a number of core laws that produce and reinforce inequality between the Arabs and the Jews in Israel. ... The official bias is not restricted to symbols such as the Israeli flag, but also to deeper legal issues concerning all Palestinian Arabs ... [t]he official definition of Israel as a Jewish state created a fortified ideological barrier in the face of obtaining full equality for the Palestinian Arab citizens of Israel ... We, the Palestinians in Israel, are an integral part of this place ... Israel has tried over the past decades to disengage us from this place, not through physical transfer but through intellectual emotional transfer. Israel has tried to create a new identity on the basis of 'loyalty to the state' ... The State has not determined a position acceptable to us yet in terms of nurturing our Arab culture.\n, the former \n, has argued that since the \n (Star of David) is also considered to be an Islamic symbol, Arab citizens of Israel should be able to feel the same sense of loyalty to the flag as Jewish citizens do.\n\n\nIn Israel, Independence Day takes place on 5 Iyar according to the \n, which means it falls on different dates every year under the \n. Arab citizens of Israel generally mark al-Nakba both on this day, and on 15 May, as do other Palestinians.\n Druze soldiers, however, were present at Israel's first Independence Day Parade in 1949,\n and there have since been parades for Druze and \n, as well as special events for Bedouins, on Independence Day.\n\n\nIn January 2008, the mayor of \n, Ursan Yassin, met with officials of the Israeli state committee on the celebrations for the 60th anniversary of independence and announced that Shefa-'Amr intended to take part in the celebrations. He stated: \"This is our country and we completely disapprove of the statements made by the Higher Monitoring Committee. I want to hold a central ceremony in Shefa-'Amr, raise all the flags and have a huge feast. The 40,000 residents of Shefa-'Amr feel that they are a part of the State of Israel...The desire to participate in the festivities is shared by most of the residents. We will not raise our children to hate the country. This is our country and we want to live in coexistence with its Jewish residents.\"\n\n\nAs of 2022, only 5% of East Jerusalem Palestinians had Israeli citizenship, despite Israel's having unilaterally annexed the area in 1967. From 1967–1974 hundreds per year became Israeli, which the \n attributes to then-lax Israeli policy, also noting that by the mid-1970s, Palestinian society started to disapprove of becoming Israeli, seeing it as complicit with or collaborating with Israeli occupation. Since 2005, the \n that separates them from Palestinians in the West Bank has changed education and employment markets, and the taboo has weakened — (Israeli citizenship no longer seen as detracting from being Palestinian. However, Israel's \n made the process more difficult. From 2002–2021, only 34% of naturalization applications were approved, and the process may take years. Israel may justify the rejection for any of a wide variety of reasons such as a family member owning land or having a utility bill in the West Bank, posting the Palestinian flag or mentioning the \n on social media, a past failed Hebrew proficiency test, refusal to renounce Jordanian citizenship, minor criminal charges, or \"security impediments\". Non-citizens cannot vote in Israeli legislative elections; to travel abroad they must get a \n, many jobs are closed to them, and Israel can at any time revoke their residency status, whereby they lose their health insurance, their right to enter Jerusalem, and thus usually also their source of income.\n\n\nOn 31 July 2003, Israel enacted the \n (Temporary Provision), 5763–2003, a one-year amendment to Israel's Citizenship Law denying citizenship and Israeli residence to Palestinians who reside in the \n or \n and who marry Israelis;\n the rule has been waived for any Palestinian \"who identifies with the State of Israel and its goals, when he or a member of his family has taken concrete action to advance the security, economy or any other matter important to the State\". Defenders of the Citizenship and Entry Law say it is aimed at preventing terrorist attacks and preserving the \"Jewish character\" of Israel by restricting Arab immigration.\n The new bill was formulated in accordance with \n statistics showing that involvement in terror attacks declines with age. This newest amendment, in practice, removes restrictions from half of the Palestinian population requesting legal status through marriage in Israel. This law was upheld by a High Court decision in 2006.\n\n\nThe law expired in 2021\n and about 12,700 Palestinians married to Israeli Arab citizens are able to apply for citizenship\n but Israel has delayed all family reunification requests, maintaining the status quo.\n\n\nAlthough this law theoretically applies to all Israelis, it has disproportionately affected Arab citizens of Israel;\n Arabs are far more likely to have Palestinian spouses than other Israelis.\n Thus the law has been widely considered discriminatory\n and the \n Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination has unanimously approved a resolution saying that the Israeli law violated an international human rights treaty against racism.\n\n\nUpon expiration the law was extended for six months in August 2004, and again for four months in February 2005.\n On 8 May 2005, the Israeli ministerial committee for issues of legislation once again amended the Citizenship and Entry into Israel Law, to restrict citizenship and residence in Israel only to Palestinian men over the age of 35, and Palestinian women over the age of 25.\n\nThe law expired in 2021\n and about 12,700 Palestinians married to Israeli Arab citizens are able to apply for citizenship\n but Israel has delayed all family reunification requests, maintaining the status quo.\n\n\nThe \n stated that the State of Israel would ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex, and guaranteed freedom of religion, conscience, language, education and culture. While formally equal according to Israeli law, a number of official sources acknowledge that Arab citizens of Israel experience discrimination in many aspects of life. Israeli High Court Justice (Ret.) Theodor Or wrote in \n:\n\n\nThe Arab citizens of Israel live in a reality in which they experience discrimination as Arabs. This inequality has been documented in a large number of professional surveys and studies, has been confirmed in court judgments and government resolutions, and has also found expression in reports by the state comptroller and in other official documents. Although the Jewish majority's awareness of this discrimination is often quite low, it plays a central role in the sensibilities and attitudes of Arab citizens. This discrimination is widely accepted, both within the Arab sector and outside it, and by official assessments, as a chief cause of agitation.\nThe Or Commission report also states that activities by Islamic organizations may be using religious pretenses to further political aims. The commission describes such actions as a factor in 'inflaming' the Muslim population in Israel against the authorities, and cites the \n mosque episode, with Muslims' attempts to restore the mosque and Jewish attempts to stop them, as an example of the 'shifting of dynamics' of the relationship between Muslims and the Israeli authorities.\n\nAccording to the 2004 U.S. State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Israel and the Occupied Territories, the Israeli government had done \"little to reduce institutional, legal, and societal discrimination against the country's Arab citizens\".\n\n\n notes that:\n\n notes that:\n\n has charged that cuts in veteran benefits and child allowances based on parents' military service discriminate against Arab children: \"The cuts will also affect the children of Jewish ultra-orthodox parents who do not serve in the military, but they are eligible for extra subsidies, including educational supplements, not available to Palestinian Arab children.\"\n\n\nAccording to \n, in 2006 just 5% of civil servants were Arabs, many of them hired to deal with other Arabs, despite the fact that Arab citizens of Israel comprise 20% of the population.\n\n\nAlthough the Bedouin infant mortality rate is still the highest in Israel, and one of the highest in the developed world, \n reports that in the 2002 budget, Israel's health ministry allocated Arab communities less than 1% of its budget for healthcare facility development.\n\n\nIn March 2010, a report released by several Israeli civil rights groups stated that the current \n was \"the most racist in Israeli history\" with 21 bills proposed in 2008 and 2009 that would discriminate against the country's Arab minority.\n\n\nA preliminary report commissioned by Israel's Courts Administration and the Israel Bar Association found in 2011 that Israeli Arabs are more likely than Israeli Jews to be convicted of crimes after being charged, more likely to be given custodial sentences, and were given longer sentences. It did not account for \"mitigating or aggravating circumstances, prior criminal record and the convict's gender\".\n\n\nThe \n (JNF) is a private organization established in 1901 to buy and develop land in the \n for Jewish settlement; land purchases were funded by donations from world Jewry exclusively for that purpose.\n The JNF currently owns 13% of land in Israel,\n while 80% is owned by the government, and the rest, around 7%, is evenly divided between private Arab and Jewish owners.\n Thus, the \n (ILA) administers 94% of the land in Israel.\n A significant portion of JNF lands were originally properties left behind by Palestinian \"absentees\" and as a result the legitimacy of some JNF land ownership has been a matter of dispute.\n The JNF purchased these lands from the State of Israel between 1949 and 1953, after the state took control of them according to the \n.\n While the JNF charter specifies the land is for the use of the Jewish People, land has been leased to \n herders.\n Nevertheless, JNF land policy has been criticized as discrimination.\n When the ILA leased JNF land to Arabs, it took control of the land in question and compensated the JNF with an equivalent amount of land in areas not designated for development (generally in the \n and the \n), thus ensuring that the total amount of land owned by the JNF remains the same.\n This was a complicated and controversial mechanism, and in 2004 use of it was suspended. After Supreme Court discussions and a directive by the Attorney General instructing the ILA to lease JNF land to Arabs and Jews alike, in September 2007 the JNF suggested reinstating the land-exchange mechanism.\n\n\nWhile the JNF and the ILA view an exchange of lands as a long-term solution, opponents say that such maneuvers privatize municipal lands and preserve a situation in which significant lands in Israel are not available for use by all of its citizens.\n As of 2007, the High Court delayed ruling on JNF policy regarding leasing lands to non-Jews,\n and changes to the ILA-JNF relationship were up in the air.\n \n and other organizations furthermore express concern that proposed severance of the relation between the ILA and JNF, as suggested by \n, would leave the JNF free to retain the same proportion of lands for Jewish uses as it seeks to settle hundreds of thousands of Jews in areas with a tenuous Jewish demographic majority (in particular, 100,000 Jews in existing \n communities\n and 250,000 Jews in new \n communities via the \n).\n\n\nThe \n, which administers 93% of the land in Israel (including the land owned by the \n), refuses to lease land to non-Jewish foreign nationals, who include Palestinian residents of Jerusalem who have identity cards but are not citizens of Israel. When ILA land is \"bought\" in Israel it is actually leased to the \"owner\" for a period of 49 years. According to article 19 of the ILA lease, foreign nationals are excluded from leasing ILA land, and in practice foreigners may just show that they qualify as Jewish under the Law of Return.\n\n\nIsraeli law also discriminates between Jewish and Arab residents of Jerusalem regarding rights to recover property owned before the dislocations created by the \n.\n The 1950 \n said that any property within post-war Israel which was owned by an \n who had left the country between 29 November 1947 and 19 May 1948, or by a \n who had merely been abroad or in area of Palestine held by hostile forces up to 1 September 1948, lost all rights to that property. Palestinians who fled or were expelled from their homes by Jewish or Israeli forces, before and during the 1948 Arab–Israeli war, but remained within the borders of what would become Israel, that is, those currently known as Arab citizens of Israel, are deemed \n by the legislation. Present absentees are regarded as absent by the Israeli government because they left their homes, even if they did not intend to leave them for more than a few days, and even if they did so involuntarily.\n\n\nFollowing the 1967 Six-Day War in which Israel occupied the \n, from where it annexed \n, Israel then passed in 1970 the \n allowing for Jews who had lost property in East Jerusalem and the West Bank during the 1948 war to reclaim it.\n Palestinian residents of Jerusalem (absentees) in the same positions, and Arab Israelis (present absentees), who owned property in West Jerusalem or other areas within the state of Israel, and lost it as a result of the 1948 war, cannot recover their properties. Israeli legislation, therefore, allows Jews to recover their land, but not Arabs.\n\n\nIn the early 2000s, several \n in the Negev and the Galilee were accused of barring Arab applicants from moving in. In 2010, the \n passed legislation that allowed admissions committees to function in smaller communities in the Galilee and the Negev, while explicitly forbidding committees to bar applicants based on the basis of race, religion, sex, ethnicity, disability, personal status, age, parenthood, sexual orientation, country of origin, political views, or political affiliation.\n Critics, however, say the law gives the privately run admissions committees a wide latitude over public lands, and believe it will worsen discrimination against the Arab minority.\n\n\nWhile groups are not separated by official policy, Israel has a number of different sectors within the society that maintain their strong cultural, religious, ideological, and/or ethnic identity. The Israeli foreign ministry maintains that in spite of the existing social cleavages and economic disparities, the political systems and the courts represent strict legal and civic equality. The Israeli foreign ministry describes the country as: \"Not a meltingpot society, but rather more of a mosaic made up of different population groups coexisting in the framework of a democratic state\".\n\n\nAccording to \n, an Arab citizen of Israel and the nation's first high-ranking Muslim in the Israeli foreign service, while Israeli society is far from perfect, minorities in Israel fare far better than any other country in the Middle East. He wrote:\n\n\nI am a proud Israeli – along with many other non-Jewish Israelis such as Druze, Bahai, Bedouin, Christians and Muslims, who live in one of the most culturally diversified societies and the only true democracy in the Middle East. Like America, Israeli society is far from perfect, but let us deal honestly. By any yardstick you choose – educational opportunity, economic development, women and gay's rights, freedom of speech and assembly, legislative representation – Israel's minorities fare far better than any other country in the Middle East.\nIntermarriage is prohibited by the Jewish \n.\n In the case of mixed Arab-Jewish marriages, emotions run especially high. A 2007 opinion survey found that more than half of Israeli Jews believed intermarriage was equivalent to national treason. A group of Jewish men in the \n neighborhood of \n started patrolling the neighborhood to stop Jewish women from dating Arab men. The municipality of \n has also announced an initiative to providing a telephone hotline for friends and family to report Jewish girls who date Arab men as well as psychologists to provide counselling. The city of \n launched a campaign in schools to warn Jewish girls against dating local Bedouin men.\n\n\nA 2015 survey found that 82% of Israeli Muslims, 87% of Israeli Druze, and 88% of Israeli Christians would be uncomfortable with a child of theirs marrying a Jew. 97% of Israeli Jews would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a Muslim and 89% would be uncomfortable if a child of theirs married a Christian.\n\n\nIn 2018, Arab-Israeli journalist \n married Jewish-Israeli actor \n,\n triggering a public controversy. A number of Israeli right-wing politicians, such as \n, criticized HaLevy's marriage to an Arab Muslim woman as \"\n\" while many members of the \n, including other government officials, congratulated the couple and dismissed their colleagues as \n.\n\n\nThe Mossawa Center – an advocacy organization for Arabs in Israel – blames the Knesset of discrimination against Arabs, citing a 75% increase in discriminatory and racist bills submitted to the Knesset in the year 2009. According to the report, 11 bills deemed by the center to be \"discriminatory and racist\" were placed on the legislature's table in 2007, while 12 such bills were initiated in 2008. However, in 2009 a full 21 bills deemed discriminatory by the Mossawa Center were discussed in the Knesset.\n\n\nThe reports categorizes as \"racist\" proposals such as giving academic scholarships to soldiers who served in combat units, and a bill to revoke government funding from organizations acting \"against the principles of the State\".\n The Coalition Against Racism and the Mossawa Center said that the proposed legislation seeks to de-legitimize Israel's Arab citizens by decreasing their civil rights.\n\n\nIn 2011, Nazareth had over 20 Arab-owned high-tech companies, mostly in the field of software development. According to the \n newspaper the city has been called the \"Silicon Valley of the Arab community\" in view of its potential in this sphere.\n\n\nInequality in the allocation of public funding for Jewish and Arab needs, and widespread employment discrimination, present significant economic hurdles for Arab citizens of Israel.\n On the other hand, the \n (MAR) group states that \"despite obvious discrimination, Israeli Arabs are relatively much better off economically than neighboring Arabs.\"\n\n\nThe predominant feature of the Arab community's economic development after 1949 was its transformation from a predominantly peasant farming population to a proletarian industrial workforce. It has been suggested that the economic development of the community was marked by distinct stages. The first period, until 1967, was characterised by this process of proletarianisation. From 1967 on, economic development of the population was encouraged and an Arab \n began to develop on the margin of the Jewish bourgeoisie. From the 1980s on, the community developed its economic and, in particular, industrial potential.\n\n\nIn July 2006, the Government categorized all Arab communities in the country as 'class A' development areas, thus making them eligible for tax benefits. This decision aims to encourage investments in the Arab sector.\n\n\nRaanan Dinur, director-general of Prime Minister office, said in December 2006 that Israel had finalized plans to set up a NIS 160 million private equity fund to help develop the businesses of the country's Arab community over the next decade. According to Dinur, companies owned by Arab citizens of Israel will be eligible to apply to the fund for as much as NIS 4 million (US$952,000), enabling as many as 80 enterprises to receive money over the next 10 years. The Israeli government will, according to Dinur, solicit bids to operate the fund from various financial institutes and private firms, which must pledge to raise at least NIS 80 million (about US$19 million) from private investors.\n\n\nIn February 2007, \n reported that 53 percent of the impoverished families in Israel were Arabs.\n Since the majority of Arabs in Israel do not serve in the army, they are ineligible for many financial benefits such as scholarships and housing loans.\n\n\nArab towns in Israel are reluctant to collect city taxes from their residents.\n Sikkuy, a prominent Arab-Jewish NGO, found that Arabs as a group have the highest home ownership in Israel: 93% compared to 70% among Jews.\n\n\nWhile per capita income is lower in the Arab community, these figures do not take into account age (the average age in the Arab community is lower and young people earn less), the low percentage of women who join the workforce, and the large size of Arab families.\n\n\nIn 2005, of the 40 towns in Israel with the highest unemployment rates, 36 were Arab towns.\n According to the Central Bank of Israel statistics for 2003, salary averages for Arab workers were 29% lower than for Jewish workers.\n Difficulties in procuring employment have been attributed to a comparatively low level of education vis-a-vis their Jewish counterparts, insufficient employment opportunities in the vicinity of their towns, discrimination by Jewish employers, and competition with foreign workers in fields, such as construction and agriculture.\n Arab women have a higher unemployment rate in the work force relative to both religious and secular Jewish women. While among Arab men the employment was found to be on par with Jewish men, 17% of Arab women were found to be employed. This puts the Arab employment at 68% of the Israeli average. The Druze and Christian Arabs have higher employment than Muslims.\n\n\nImad Telhami, founder and CEO of Babcom, a call center in the \n Industrial Park with 300 employees, is committed to developing career opportunities for Arab workers in Israel. Telhami, a Christian Arab, was a senior executive at the \n textile plant before establishing Babcom. He hopes to employ 5,000 workers within five years: \"Israeli companies have been exporting thousands of jobs to India, Eastern Europe and other spots around the globe. I want to bring the jobs here. There are terrific engineers in the Arab sector, and the potential is huge.\n\n\nIn March 2010, the government approved a $216 million, five-year development plan for the Israeli Arab sector with the goal of increasing job accessibility, particularly for women and academics. Under this program, some 15,000 new employees will be added to the work roster by 2014.\n\n\nBy the 2010s, the Israeli-Arab standard of living was found to be improving, with the number of middle class Arabs growing. In 2017, \n, which termed Arabs as Israel's \"new \n\", reported that Arabs, especially women, were pursuing higher education in increasing numbers, and increasingly seeking white-collar jobs. According to Professor Aziz Haidar of the \n, in 2017 about 27% of Arabs were \n (as opposed to 17% two decades before) and 3% were wealthy, and although most Arabs were still in lower-income brackets, the Arab middle class is expanding dramatically.\n\n\nAcross all groups, \n tend to be the most educated,\n and most of them are \n and \n, and they have the lowest incidence of poverty and the lowest percentage of unemployment;\n a study published by the Taub Center for Social Policy Studies in 2017 found that \"Christian population has the highest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices: \n scores, rates of \n, and fields of employment\".\n The study found also that the achievements of the \n are mixed, and they have the second highest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices.\n While Bedouins has the lowest achievements in the Arab sector on all indices, as they tend to be the least educated.\n\n\nThe most common health-related causes of death are heart disease and cancer. Roughly 14% were diagnosed with diabetes in 2000.\n Around half of all Arab men smoke.\n Life expectancy has increased 27 years since 1948. Further, due largely to improvements in health care, the Arab \n rate dropped from 32 deaths per thousand births in 1970 to 8.6 per thousand in 2000.\n However, the \n infant mortality rate is still the highest in Israel, and one of the highest in the developed world.\n\nIn 2003, the \n rate among Arab citizens overall was 8.4 per thousand, more than twice as high as the rate 3.6 per thousand among the Jewish population.\n In the 2002 budget, Israel's health ministry allocated Arab communities less than 1% of its 277 m-shekel (£35m) budget (1.6 m shekels {£200,000}) to develop healthcare facilities.\n\n\nNazareth have three private hospitals serving its districts: \n (also called the English Hospital), French Nazareth Hospital, and the Italian Nazareth Hospital. All of these hospitals run by the Christian community of Nazareth.\n The Christian Arab community run also the \n.\n\n\nDespite the fact that Arab represent 20% of the total Israeli population, in 2015 they accounted 35% of all doctors in Israel, and according to a study by the \n Arabs account about 35% of all pharmacists in Israel.\n The Arabic local council \n has one of the highest numbers of doctors per capita in the world.\n\n\nThe Israeli government regulates and finances most of the schools operating in the country, including the majority of those run by private organizations. The national school system has two major branches – a Hebrew-speaking branch and an Arabic-speaking branch. The curricula for the two systems are almost identical in mathematics, sciences, and English. It is different in humanities (history, literature, etc.). While Hebrew is taught as a second language in Arab schools since the third grade and obligatory for Arabic-speaking school's matriculation exams, only basic knowledge of Arabic is taught in Hebrew-speaking schools, usually from the 7th to the 9th grade. Arabic is not obligatory for Hebrew speaking school's matriculation exams. The schooling language split operates from preschool, up to the end of high school. At the university level, they merge into a single system, which operates mostly in Hebrew and in English.\n\n\nIn 2001, \n described government-run Arab schools as \"a world apart from government-run Jewish schools.\"\n The report found striking differences in virtually every aspect of the education system.\n\n\nIn 2005, the Follow-Up Committee for Arab Education said that the Israeli government spent an average of $192 a year on Arab students compared to $1,100 for Jewish students. The drop-out rate for Arabs was twice as high as for Jews (12% versus 6%). There was a 5,000-classroom shortage in the Arab sector.\n\n\nAccording to the 2004 \n \n for Israel and the occupied territories, \"Israeli Arabs were underrepresented in the student bodies and faculties of most universities and in higher professional and business ranks. Well educated Arabs often were unable to find jobs commensurate with their level of education. According to Sikkuy, Arab citizens held approximately 60 to 70 of the country's 5,000 university faculty positions.\"\n\n\nArab educators have long voiced concerns over institutionalized budgetary discrimination. An August 2009 study published by the \n's School of Education claimed that Israel's \n discriminated against Arabs in its allocations of special assistance for students from low socioeconomic backgrounds and the average per-student allocation at Arab junior high schools was one-fifth the average at Jewish ones. This was due to the allocation method: funds were first divided between Arab and Jewish school systems according to the number of students in each, and then allocated to needy students; however, due to the large proportion of such students in the Arab sector, they receive less funds, per student, than Jewish students. The Ministry of Education said it was discontinuing this method in favor of a uniform index.\n Ministry data on the percentage of high school students who passed their matriculation exams showed that Arab towns were ranked lowest except for \n, which had the third highest pass rate (76%) in Israel.\n\n\nAccording to the study by scholar Hanna David from the \n, Arab Christian schools in Israel are among the best schools in the country, and while those schools represent only 4% of the Arab schooling sector, about 34% of Arab university students come from Christian schools,\n and about 87% of the Israeli Arabs in the \n sector have been educated in Arab \n.\n These 47 Arab Christian schools accommodate 33,000 Christian students, Muslims, Druze and some Jews from across the country.\n\n\nNearly half of Arab students who passed their matriculation exams failed to win a place in higher education because they performed poorly in the \n, compared to 20% of Jewish applicants. Khaled Arar, a professor at \n, believes the psychometric test is culturally biased: \"The gap in psychometric scores between Jewish and Arab students has remained steady – at more than 100 points out of a total of 800 – since 1982. That alone should have raised suspicions.\"\n\n\nHowever, a 1986 research found negligible differences in construct or predictive test validity across varying cultural groups and the findings appeared to be more consistent with the psychometric than with the cultural bias position.\n\n\nAccording to the Israeli \n census in 2020, 83.6% of Christians were entitled to a \n, followed by Druze (79.9%), and Muslims (60.3%). While 80.2% of the Israeli Jews were entitled to a \n.\n\n\nStatistically, \n in Israel have the highest rates of \n among all religious communities, according to a data by \n in 2010, 63% of Israeli \n have had college or \n, the highest of any religious and \n group.\n According to the Israeli \n census in 2020, 70.9% of \n in Israel have a \n,\n followed by \n (15.3%),\n and \n (10%).\n\n\nAmong Israeli higher education institutions the \n has the largest percentage (41%) of Arab-Israeli students.\n The \n has the second largest percentage (22.2%) of Arab-Israeli students.\n\n\nArab citizens are not \n in the Israeli military, and, outside the Bedouin community, very few (around 120 a year) volunteer.\n Until 2000, each year between 5–10% of the \n population of draft age volunteered for the \n, and Bedouin were well known for their unique status as volunteers. The legendary Israeli soldier, \n, first commander of the Shaked Reconnaissance Battalion in the \n, was a Bedouin (born \n). Bedouin soldiers dominate the elite human tracking units that guard Israel's northern and southern border.\n Lieutenant Colonel Magdi Mazarib, a Bedouin, who is the Israeli army's highest-ranking tracking commander, told the \n that he believes that \"the state of Bedouin in Israel is better, as far as the respect we get, our progress, education\".\n Today the number of Bedouin in the army may be less than 1%.\n A 2003 report stated that willingness among Bedouin to serve in the army had drastically dropped in recent years, as the Israeli government has failed to fulfill promises of equal service provision to Bedouin citizens.\n However, a 2009 article in \n stated that volunteer recruitment for a crack elite Bedouin army unit rose threefold.\n\n\nIDF figures indicate that, in 2002 and 2003, Christians represented 0.1 percent of all recruits. In 2004, the number of recruits had doubled. Altogether, in 2003, the percentage of Christians serving had grown by 16 percent over the year 2000. The IDF does not publish figures on the exact number of recruits by religious denomination, and it is estimated that merely a few dozen Christians currently serve in the IDF.\n\n\nThe Druze are required to serve in the \n in accordance with an agreement between their local religious leaders and the Israeli government in 1956. Opposition to the decision among the Druze populace was evident immediately, but was unsuccessful in reversing the decision.\n It is estimated that 85% of Druze men in Israel serve in the army,\n many of them becoming officers\n and some rising to general officer rank.\n In recent years, a growing minority from within the Druze community have denounced this mandatory enrollment, and refused to serve.\n In 2001, \n, who identifies as a Palestinian Druze and serves as the head of the Balad party's national council, founded the \"Pact of Free Druze\", an organization that aims \"to stop the conscription of the Druze and claims the community is an inalienable part of the Arabs in Israel and the Palestinian nation at large\".\n\n\nRather than perform army service, Israeli Arab youths have the option to volunteer to \n and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. As of 2010\n there are 1,473 Arabs volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counseling youths to refrain from performing services to the state. According to a National Service official: \"For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state's call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits.\"\n\n\nIn a 2004 survey by Sammy Smooha of the \n \n, 85% of Israeli Arabs stated that Israel has a right to exist as an independent state, and 70% that it has a right to exist as a democratic, Jewish state.\n A \n survey from 2005 found that 63% of the Arab citizens accepted the principle that Israel is the state of the Jewish people.\n\n\nA 2006 poll by the Arab advocacy group \n showed negative attitudes towards Arabs. The poll found that 63% of Jews believe Arabs are a security threat; 68% would refuse to live in the same building as an Arab; 34% believe that Arab culture is inferior to Israeli culture. Support for segregation between Jewish and Arab citizens was higher among Jews of Middle Eastern origin.\n\n\nIn a 2006 patriotism survey, 56% of Israeli Arabs were not proud of their citizenship and 73% were not ready to fight to defend the state, but 77% said that Israel was better than most other countries and 53% were proud of the country's welfare system. Eighty-two percent said they would rather be a citizen of Israel than of any other country in the world.\n\n\nAn \n (IDI) poll in 2007 showed that 75% of \"Israeli Arabs would support a constitution that maintained Israel's status as a Jewish and democratic state while guaranteeing equal rights for minorities, while 23% said they would oppose such a definition\".\n Another survey that year showed that 62% of Israel's Arabs would prefer to remain Israeli citizens rather than become citizens of a future Palestinian state.\n A separate 2008 poll found that 77% would rather live in Israel than in any other country in the world.\n Another 2007 poll by Sammy Smooha found that 63% of Jewish Israelis avoided entering Arab towns and cities; 68% feared the possibility of widespread civil unrest among Israeli Arabs; 50% of Israeli Arabs justified Hezbollah's capture of IDF reservists \n and \n in a cross-border raid; 19% thought Israel was justified in going to war following the kidnapping; 48% justified Hezbollah rocket attacks on northern Israel during the \n; 89% of Israeli Arabs saw the IDF bombing of Lebanon as a war crime, while 44% of Israeli Arabs viewed Hezbollah's bombing of Israel as a war crime; 62% of Israeli Arabs worried that Israel could transfer their communities to the jurisdiction of a future Palestinian state, and 60% said they were concerned about a possible mass expulsion; 76% of Israeli Arabs described \n as racist; 68% of Israeli Arabs would be content to live in the Jewish state alongside a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip; 41% of Israeli Arab citizens \n.\n\n\nIn 2007, the \n reported a \"dramatic increase\" in racism against Arab citizens, including a 26 percent rise in anti-Arab incidents. ACRI president \n said that \"Israeli society is reaching new heights of racism that damages freedom of expression and privacy\".\n\n\nA 2008 poll on intercommunal relations by Harvard \n found that Arabs and Jews in Israel underestimated the extent to which their communities \"liked\" one another. 68% of the Jews supported teaching Arabic in Jewish schools.\n\n\nA 2008 poll by the Center Against Racism found that 75% of Israeli Jews would not live in a building with Arabs; over 60% would not invite Arabs to their homes; 40% believed that Arabs should be stripped of the \n; over 50% agreed that the State should encourage emigration of Arab citizens to other countries; 59% considered Arab culture primitive. Asked \"What do you feel when you hear people speaking Arabic?\" 31% said hate and 50% said fear. Only 19% reported positive or neutral feelings.\n\n\nSurveys in 2009 found a radicalization in the positions of Israeli Arabs towards the State of Israel, with 41% of Israeli Arabs recognizing Israel's right to exist as a \n and democratic state (down from 66% in 2003), and 54% believing Israel has a right to exist as an independent country (down from 81% in 2003). Polls also showed that 40% of Arab citizens engaged in \n.\n\n\nA 2010 poll of Israeli high school students found that 50% did not think Israeli Arabs were entitled to the same rights as Jews in Israel, and 56% thought Arabs should not be elected to the \n.\n The figures rose among religious students.\n\n\nA 2010 Arab Jewish Relations Survey, compiled by Prof. Sami Smoocha in collaboration with the Jewish-Arab Center at the University of Haifa shows that 71% Arab citizens of Israel said they blamed Jews for the hardships suffered by Palestinians during and after the \"Nakba\" in 1948. 38% denied the Holocaust. The percentage supporting the use of violence to advance Arab causes climbed from 6% in 1995 to 12% in 2010. 66% say they reject Israel as a Jewish and Zionist state, while 30% opposed its existence under any terms. 63% saw the Jews as \"foreign settlers who do not fit into the region and will eventually leave, when the land will return to the Palestinians\".\n\n\nA 2010 University of Maryland / Zogby International poll of 600 Arab Israelis compiled by \n found that 36 percent considered their Arab identity to be \"most important\", while 22% answered \"Palestinian\", 19% Muslim, and 12% Israeli.\n\n\nAmongst other things, a 2012 survey by Mada al-Carmel, the Arab Center for Applied Social Research, asked Arab students what obstacles they felt they faced in getting into university: 71% said the psychometric exam was the primary obstacle, while 40% cited \"Jewish racism\".\n The survey also found that 45 percent of those questioned felt no pride in Israeli achievements in whatever field, with another 13% reporting negative feelings about them.\n\n\nA Pew Research poll released in March 2016 showed that close to half of all Israeli Jews are in favor of \"transferring or expelling\" Israel's Arab population. 48% of Israeli Jews strongly agree or agree with the idea, and 46% strongly disagree or disagree. The in-person polling was conducted in a relatively \"calm\" from late 2014 through early 2015.\n\n\nIn December 2022, support for a two-state solution was 33% among Palestinians, 34% among Israeli Jews, and 60% among Israeli Arabs.\n At the end of October 2023, after the \n, the two-state solution had the support of 71.9% of Israeli Arabs and 28.6% of Israeli Jews.\n According to a poll published by the \n, only 24% of Israeli Arabs believe that the \n is trying to uphold international law in the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\nBecause Israeli Arabs have Israeli citizenship, they have become increasingly targeted for recruitment as operatives by organizations that attack civilians.\n According to the Israeli General Security Service (Shabak), from 2001 to 2004, at the height of the Second Intifada, there were 102 cases where some Arab-Israelis were involved in some way in terrorist attacks killing hundreds of Israelis.\n In 2001, for example, passengers disembarking from a train in \n were attacked by an Israeli Arab who killed 3 and wounded 90.\n In March 2007, two Israeli Arabs were convicted of manslaughter for smuggling a suicide bomber into Israel.\n\n\nFrom 2000 to 2004, some 150 Arabs from East Jerusalem were arrested for participation in such attacks.\n\n\nHezbollah has taken advantage of family and criminal ties with Israeli-Arabs who can easily cross the border into Lebanon, meet with Palestinians in the \n and the \n, transfer weapons, drugs and money to Israel, gather intelligence and recruit operatives. This phenomenon is particularly widespread in the village of \n. Arab citizens of Israel have been convicted of espionage for Hezbollah.\n Arab-Israeli terror cells have been established, such as a cell in \n whose members were arrested in February 2004.\n\n\nAlexander Yakobson of Jerusalem's Hebrew University has said \"There is very little actual violence between Israeli Jews and Israeli Arabs. Given the length and the intensity of the conflict, that is both surprising and encouraging.\"\n\n\nIn the 1956 \n, 48 unarmed Arab citizens, returning to their village, were gunned down by an Israel Border Police platoon; a curfew had been imposed, but the villagers were not informed of it. Arab citizens have also been killed by Israeli security forces in the wake of violent demonstrations and riots, such as the March 1976 \n demonstrations, which left 6 dead, and the \n in which 12 Israeli Arabs and one Palestinian from Gaza were killed.\n\nIn 2005 an \n \n soldier, \n opened fire in a bus in \n in northern Israel, murdering four Arabs and wounding twenty-two others. No group had taken credit for the terrorist attack and an official in the settler movement denounced it.\n\n\nArab activists have complained about the police abandoning Arab towns to intra communal violence at the hands of common criminals and murderers, calling for cooperation with Israeli police and internal security services under the slogan of \"Arab Lives Matter\".\n\n\nArab citizens have also been victims of Palestinian, Arab, or Islamist attacks on Israel and Israelis. For example, on 12 September 1956, three \n guards were killed in an attack on Ein Ofarim, in the \n region.\n Two Arab citizens were killed in the \n carried out by the \n on 15 May 1974. In March 2002, a resident of the Arab town of \n was killed in an attack on a Haifa restaurant.\n Two months later, a woman from \n was killed in a \n \n in \n.\n On 18 June 2002, a woman from the Arab border town of \n was one of 19 killed by Hamas in the \n in \n.\n In August 2002, a man from the Arab town of \n and woman from the Druze village of \n were killed in a suicide bombing at \n junction.\n On 21 October 2002, an \n man and a \n woman were among 14 killed by \n in the \n.\n On 5 March 2003, a 13-year-old girl from the Druze town of \n was one of 17 killed in the \n.\n In May 2003, a \n man was killed in an \n mall suicide bombing.\n On 19 March 2004, \n \n gunmen killed \n, a \n student.\n On 12 December 2004, five Arab IDF soldiers were killed in an explosion and shooting at the border with Egypt for which the \n claimed responsibility.\n On 4 October 2003, four Arab citizens of Israel were among the 21 killed by \n in the \n. In July 2006, 19 Arab citizens were killed due to \n rocket fire in the course of the \n.\n\nOn 22 August 2006, 11 Arab tourists from Israel were killed when their \n in Egypt's \n. Israel sent \n, but the ambulances waited for hours at the border before receiving Egyptian permission to enter and treat the wounded, responsible for at least one of the deaths. The victims say that the driver acted as part of a planned terrorist attack, and are attempting to receive compensation from the government.\n\n\nDuring the \n, according to \n, Fatah backed a call for a general strike on 18 May 2021 in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem and Palestinians in Israel were asked to take part.\n In an unusual display of unity by \"Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up 20% of its population, and those in the territories Israel seized in 1967\"\n the strike went ahead and \"shops were shuttered across cities in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and in villages and towns inside Israel\".\n\n\nMany Arab citizens of Israel share in the culture of the \n and wider Arab region of which many of them form a part. There are still some women who produce Palestinian cultural products such as \n,\n and \n. The Palestinian folk dance, known as the \n, continues to be taught to youth in cultural groups, and is often danced at weddings and other parties.\n\nAs the largest Arab city in Israel, \n is a cultural, political, economic and commercial center of the Arab citizens of Israel, and became also a center of Arab and \n.\n Haifa, however, is the center of liberal \n, as it was under British colonial rule. Arabs in Haifa (mostly Christians and Muslims) tend to be wealthier and better educated compared to Arabs elsewhere in Israel.\n An active Arab cultural life has developed in the 21st century.\n Haifa is center of many Arab-owned businesses such as \n, \n, cafes, \n and \n which host also a different cultural discussions and art exhibitions.\n\n\nOther centers of Arab and Palestinian cultures includes \n and \n. According to the historian \n, \n is the \"most academic Arab town in Israel\",\n while journalist Sylvia Smith calls it \"the preeminent [Arab] cultural town\".\n With the near total depopulation of the Palestinian Arabs in the major cities of Haifa and Jaffa as a result of the 1948 war, Kafr Yasif and \n became one of a few villages in the newly established state of Israel to emerge as a central space for Arab culture and politics.\n Its schools, proximity and location between major cities and other Arab villages, the relatively equal distribution of land ownership among its households and the diversity brought about by the influx of internally displaced Palestinians all contributed to its local importance.\n\n\nIn 1948, it was the only Arab locality in the Galilee to contain a high school outside of the cities of Nazareth, Shefa-Amr and Haifa.\n Following the war, the high school enrolled students from over fifty Arab villages.\n Several students, including \n, became well-known poets, and the village hosted weekly poetry recitals.\n As of the 1960s, the people of \n have been noted for their high levels of education and standards of living.\n\nLinguistically speaking, the majority of Arabic citizens of Israel are fluently bilingual, speaking both a \n dialect and \n. In Arab homes and towns, the primary language spoken is Arabic. Some Hebrew words have entered the colloquial Arabic dialect. For example, Arabs often use the word \n (equivalent of \"Okay\") while speaking Arabic. Other Hebrew words that are regularly interspersed are \n (stoplight), \n (air conditioner), and \n (computer). The resulting dialect is usually referred to as 'Israeli Arabic'.\n\nSuch borrowings are often \"Arabized\" to reflect not only \n but the phonology of Hebrew as spoken by Arabs. For example, the second consonant of מעונות (\n, \"dormitory\") would be pronounced as a \n rather than the \n traditionally used by the vast majority of Israeli Jews. A survey by the Central Bureau of Statistics released in 2013 found that 60% of \n were proficient or highly proficient in Hebrew, while 17% could not read it and 12% could not speak it.\n\n\nThere are different local colloquial dialects among Arabs in different regions and localities. For example, the \n residents of \n are known for pronouncing the \n sound with a \"ch\" (as-in-cheese) rather than \"k\" (as-in-kite). Some Arabic words or phrases are used only in their respective localities, such as the Nazareth word for \"now\" which is \n, and \n a local modification of the English word \"cinema\".\n The \n, especially in the villages, is often different from the other regional Israeli Arabic dialects. Druze Arabic dialect is distinguished from others by retention of the phoneme /\n/.\n They often use \n to write their Arabic dialect online.\n\n\nArab citizens of Israel tend to watch both the Arab satellite news stations and Israeli cable stations and read both Arabic and Hebrew newspapers, comparing the information against one another.\n\n\nThe \n scene in general has been supported by the contributions of Arab citizens of Israel.\n In addition to the contribution of artists such as singer \n (from \n) and \n (from \n) to evolving traditional \n and \n styles, a new generation of Arab youth in Israel has also begun asserting a Palestinian identity in new musical forms. For instance of the Palestinian hip hop group \n, from Lod, has spurred the emergence of other hip hop groups from Akka, to Bethlehem, to Ramallah, to Gaza City. \n is the first \n group.\n\n\nSinger-songwriter such as \n, \n, \n, Luay Ali, Sharif \"the druze boy\" have put Arab citizens of Israel on the musical map.\n\n\nIn the art scene, the Palestinian minority in Israel has asserted its identity according to Ben Zvi, who suggests that this group of artists who are identified \"on the one hand, as part of a broad Palestinian cultural system, and on the other — in a differentiated manner — as the Palestinian minority in Israel.\"\n The issue of identity becomes particularly clear in an artwork of the Palestinian artist \n from \n. The video performance \"untitled\" was part of the exhibition \"Men in the Sun\" in the Herzliya Museum of Contemporary Art in 2009. In the work, Raafat Hattab is seen as he pours water into a bucket in order to lengthily water an olive tree which is a sign for the lost paradise before \n.

To uproot it in the course of war\"; Morris said this resulted in a \"partial\" expulsion of Arabs.\n \n\nStill other scholars use different frameworks than \"ethnic cleansing\": for example, Richard Bessel and Claudia Haake use \"forced removal\" and Alon Confino uses \"forced migration\".\n\n\nAt the same time, many of those Palestinians who remained in Israel became \n. In 1950, \n estimated that 46,000 of the 156,000 Palestinians who remained inside the borders demarcated as Israel by the \n were internally displaced refugees.\n As of 2003, some 274,000 \n – or one in four in Israel – were \n from the events of 1948.\n\n\nThe UN Partition Plan of 1947 assigned 56% of Palestine to the future Jewish state, while the Palestinian majority, 66%, were to receive 44% of the territory. 80% of the land in the to-be Jewish state was already owned by Palestinians; 11% had a Jewish title.\n Before, during and after the 1947–1949 war, hundreds of \n and destroyed.\n \n, sometimes derivatives of the historical Palestinian nomenclature, and sometimes new inventions.\n Numerous non-Jewish historical sites were destroyed, not just during the wars, but in a subsequent process over a number of decades. For example, over 80% of Palestinian village mosques have been destroyed, and artefacts have been removed from museums and archives.\n\n\nA \n in Israel to legalize the expropriation of Palestinian land.\n\n\nThe creation of Palestinian statelessness is a central component of the Nakba and continues to be a feature of Palestinian national life to the present day.\n All Arab Palestinians became immediately stateless as a result of the Nakba, although some took on other nationalities.\n After 1948, Palestinians ceased to be simply Palestinian, instead divided into \n, East Jerusalem Palestinians, \n Palestinians, West Bank-Palestinians, and Gazan-Palestinians, each with different legal statuses and restrictions,\n in addition to the wider \n who were able to achieve residency outside of \n and the refugee camps.\n\n\nThe first \n, passed on 14 July 1952, denationalized Palestinians, rendering the former Palestinian citizenship \"devoid of substance\", \"not satisfactory and is inappropriate to the situation following the establishment of Israel\".\n\n\nThe Nakba was the primary cause of the \n; at the same time Israel was created as a Jewish homeland, the Palestinians were turned into a \"refugee nation\" with a \"wandering identity\".\n Today a majority of the 13.7 million Palestinians live in the diaspora, i.e. they live outside of the historical area of \n, primarily in other countries of the \n.\n Of the 6.2 million people registered by the UN's dedicated Palestinian refugee agency, \n,\n about 40% live in the West Bank and Gaza, and 60% in the diaspora. A large number of these diaspora refugees are not integrated into their host countries, as illustrated by the ongoing tension of \n or the \n.\n\n\nThese factors have resulted in a Palestinian identity of \"suffering\", whilst the \n of the Palestinians has created a uniting factor and focal point in the desire to return to their lost homeland.\n\n\nThe most important long-term implications of the Nakba for the Palestinian people were the loss of their homeland, the fragmentation and marginalization of their national community, and their transformation into a stateless people.\n\n\nSince the late 1990s, the phrase \"\n\" (\n: \n, \n) has emerged to describe the \"continuous experience of violence and dispossession\" experienced by the Palestinian people.\n This term enjoins the understanding of the Nakba not as an event in 1948, but as an ongoing process that continues through to the present day.\n\n\nOn November 11, 2023 Israeli \n \n remarked in an interview on \n on the nature of the \n that \"From an operational standpoint, you cannot wage a war like the IDF wants to in Gaza while the masses are between the tanks and the soldiers,\" he said. \"It's the 2023 Gaza Nakba.\"\n\n\nThe term Nakba was first applied to the events of 1948 by \n, a professor of history at the \n, in his 1948 book \n (\n).\n Zureiq wrote that \"the tragic aspect of the Nakba is related to the fact that it is not a regular misfortune or a temporal evil, but a Disaster in the very essence of the word, one of the most difficult that Arabs have ever known over their long history.\"\n Prior to 1948, the \"Year of the Catastrophe\" among \n referred to 1920, when European colonial powers \n into a series of separate states along lines of their own choosing.\n\n\nThe word was used again one year later by the Palestinian poet \n.\n Zureiq's students subsequently founded the \n in 1952, one of the first post-Nakba Palestinian political movements. In a six-volume encyclopedia \n (\n) published between 1958–60,\n \n wrote: \"How can I call it but \n [\"catastrophe\"]? When we the Arab people generally and the Palestinians particularly, faced such a disaster (Nakba) that we never faced like it along the centuries, our homeland was sealed, we [were] expelled from our country, and we lost many of our beloved sons.\"\n \n also used the term Nakba in the title of his book \n (\n) written in 1955. The use of the term has evolved over time.\n\n\nInitially, the use of the term Nakba among Palestinians was not universal. For example, for many years after 1948, \n in \n avoided and even actively resisted using the term, because it lent permanency to a situation they viewed as temporary, and they often insisted on being called \"returnees\".\n In the 1950s and 1960s, terms they used to describe the events of 1948 included \n (\"the rape\"), or were more euphemistic, such as \n (\"the events\"), \n (\"the exodus\"), and \n (\"when we blackened our faces and left\").\n Nakba narratives were avoided by the leadership of the \n (PLO) in Lebanon in the 1970s, in favor of a narrative of revolution and renewal.\n Interest in the Nakba by organizations representing refugees in Lebanon surged in the 1990s due to the perception that the refugees' \n might be negotiated away in exchange for Palestinian statehood, and the desire was to send a clear message to the international community that this right was non-negotiable.\n\n\nThe Palestinian national narrative regards the repercussions of the Nakba as a formative trauma defining its national, political and moral aspirations and its identity. The Palestinian people developed a victimized national identity in which they had lost their country as a result of the 1948 war. From the Palestinian perspective, they have been forced to pay for the Holocaust perpetrated in Europe with their freedom, properties and bodies instead of those who were truly responsible.\n\n\n, writing in the \n published by the \n, outlines the evolution of the Nakba narrative through three stages. Initially, it depicted Palestinians as victims displaced by Israel's creation to make way for Jewish immigrants. The next phase recast the \n as Israel's colonization of Palestinian lands, aligning the Palestinian cause with anti-colonial sentiments. The final stage leverages Holocaust memories, accusing Israel of \n, resonating with Western guilt over the Holocaust. He argues these evolving interpretations omit complex historical factors involving failed attempts to eliminate Israel, contested territorial claims, and \n.\n\n\nThe Israeli national narrative rejects the Palestinian characterization of 1948 as the Nakba (catastrophe), instead viewing it as the War of Independence that \n.\n  It portrays the events of 1948 as the culmination of the Zionist movement and Jewish national aspirations, resulting in military success against invading Arab armies, armistice agreements, and recognition of Israel's legitimacy by the United Nations.\n While acknowledging some instances of Israeli responsibility for the Palestinian refugee crisis, as documented by historians like Benny Morris, the overarching Israeli narrative accommodates this within the context of Israel's emergence as a state under difficult war conditions, without negating Israel's foundational story and identity.\n It perceives the 1948 war and its outcome as an equally formative and fundamental event – as an act of justice and redemption for the Jewish people after centuries of historical suffering, and the key step in the \"\n\".\n\n\nAccording to this narrative, the Palestinian Arabs voluntarily fled their homes during the war, encouraged by Arab leaders who told Palestinians to temporarily evacuate so that Arab armies \n, and then upon losing the war, refused to integrate them.\n This viewpoint also contrasts \n with \n as political pawns. In contrast to the Palestinian narrative, claims that Arab villages were depopulated and that Palestinian homes were destroyed are not acknowledged by the mainstream Israeli narrative, typically using terminology such as \"abandoned\" property and \"population exchange\" rather than \"confiscated\" or \"expelled.\"\n\n\nIsraeli officials have repeatedly described the term as embodying an \"Arab lie\" or as a justification for terrorism. In 2009, the \n banned using the term \"nakba\" in textbooks for Arab children.\n In 2011, the \n forbade institutions from commemorating the event. According to \n, a school ceremony memoralizing the Nakba would, under the 2011 law, have to respond to charges that it incited racism, violence and terrorism, and denied Israel's democratic character, in doing so.\n In 2023, after the United Nations instituted a commemoration day for the Nakba on 15 May, the Israeli ambassador \n remonstrated that the event itself was \n.\n\n\nIn May 2009, \n introduced a bill that would outlaw all Nakba commemorations, with a three-year prison sentence for such acts of remembrance.\n Following public criticism, the bill draft was changed, the prison sentence dropped and instead the \n would have the authority to reduce state funding for Israeli institutions found to be \"commemorating Independence Day or the day of the establishment of the state as a day of mourning\".\n The new draft was approved by the Knesset in March 2011, and became known as the \n.\n The implementation of the new law unintentionally promoted knowledge of the Nakba within Israeli society.\n\n\nAccording to some historians and academics, there exists a form of \n that pertains to the \n. The denial of the Nakba is central to Zionist narratives of 1948.\n The term 'Nakba denial' was used in 1998 by Steve Niva, editor of the \n, in describing how the rise of the early Internet led to competing online narratives of the events of 1948.\n In the 21st century the term came to be used by activists and scholars to describe narratives that minimized elements of the expulsion and its aftermath,\n particularly in Israeli and Western historiography before the late 1980s,\n when Israel's history began to be reviewed and rewritten by the \n.\n\n\nNakba denial has been described as still prevalent in both Israeli and American discourse and linked to various tropes associated with \n.\n In 2011, Israel enacted a law nicknamed the '\n', which authorized the withdrawal of state funds from organizations that commemorate the day on which the Israeli state was established as a day of mourning, or that deny the existence of Israel as a \"Jewish and democratic state.\"\n Israel also hosts \n movements, such as \n, that aim to commemorate the Nakba through public memorials and events.\n In May 2023, following the 75th anniversary of the Nakba, Palestinian president \n made the denial of the 1948 expulsion a crime punishable by two years in jail.\n\n\n and Alon Kadish claim that the Palestinian \n of the Nakba has evolved over time, reconstructing the events of 1948 to serve contemporary Palestinian national demands. They argue that the Palestinian historiography of the Nakba tends to \"entirely ignore\" the attacks launched by Arab \n and \n forces against the \n, downplaying the role of \n in the events leading to the 1948 war and defeat.\n\n\nElias Khoury writes that the works of \n were important for taking a \"radically new approach\" to the Nakba than those of Zureiq and other early adopters of the term, whose usage had \"the connotation of a natural catastrophe\" and thus freed \"Palestinian leadership and Arab governments from direct responsibility for the defeat.\"\n\n\n, a film about the Nakba directed by Jordanian director \n, was chosen as Jordan's official submission for the 2023 Academy Awards International Feature Film category. In response, \n, the Israeli Finance Minister, ordered the treasury to withdraw government funding for Jaffa's \n, where the film is scheduled for projection.\n\n\nThe \n held a collection of pre-Nakba jewellery.

The series premiered in the United States on \n on October 10, 2012, and ran for eight seasons until January 28, 2020. \n was primarily filmed in \n, British Columbia, Canada.\n\n follows billionaire playboy \n (\n), Robert and Moira Queen's oldest son, who claimed to have spent five years shipwrecked on \n, a mysterious island in the North China Sea, before returning home to \n (later renamed \"Star City\") to fight crime and corruption as a secret vigilante whose weapon of choice is a bow and arrow. Throughout the series, Oliver is joined by others, among them former soldier \n (\n), I.T. expert and skilled hacker \n (\n), former assassin \n (\n), aspiring vigilante \n (\n), Oliver's sister \n (\n), and attorney-turned-vigilante \n (\n).

Although \n had been featured in the television series \n from 2006 to 2011, also on The CW, the producers decided to start clean and find a new actor to portray the character. \n has received generally positive reviews from critics, and has earned multiple awards and nominations. In October 2014, a \n TV series titled \n premiered, which was later followed by other spin-off series and media, forming \n.\n\n\nThe series follows billionaire playboy \n, who spent five years shipwrecked on the mysterious island \n, before returning home to \n.\n\n\nIn \n, Oliver returns to Starling City and is reunited with his family and friends, including \n and \n.

He becomes embroiled in a conflict with \n, in order to protect his sister Thea. Felicity becomes vice-president of the now renamed Palmer Technologies and Laurel sets out to follow in Sara's footsteps, assuming the mantle of \n.

Following their final battle, a new universe is born at the cost of Oliver's life. He is then reunited with Felicity in a \"paradise dimension\",\n in the final scene of the series.\n\nThe idea for a \n TV series was first discussed during the sixth season of \n, with talk of spinning off \n's portrayal of \n into his own series. Hartley however refused to entertain the idea, feeling it was his duty to respect what \n had accomplished in five seasons, and not \"steal the spotlight\" because there was \"talk\" of a spin-off after his two appearances. According to Hartley, \"talking\" was as far as the spin-off idea ever got.\n  A spin-off series in which Oliver led the Justice League made it into early development. The series was to have been helmed by \n, who would later go on to be the showrunner for the first season of Marvel's \n.\n\n\nIn January 2012, following \ns conclusion, \n prepared a new series centered around the character Green Arrow. \n, \n and \n were announced to be developing the series.\n A week later, the series was ordered to \n with \n signed to direct. Nutter also directed \n for \n, the aforementioned series following \n on his journey to become \n.\n When developing the series, producer Marc Guggenheim expressed that the creative team wanted to \"chart [their] own course, [their] own destiny\", and avoid any direct connections to \n. Thus rather than continuing on with Hartley's incarnation of the character, they opted to cast a new actor in the role and establish the series as its own separate continuity.\n At the end of the same month, Stephen Amell was cast in the titular role of Oliver Queen.\n\n\nThe series does not initially feature super-powered heroes and villains. This decision was, in part, based on the executives' desire to take a realistic look at the characters in this universe.\n Production on the pilot began in March 2012 in \n,\n which would continue to act as the primary filming location for the series.\n The series' skyline shots use a combination of footage from \n, Germany, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n, Japan.\n The series was given a full season pick up on October 22, 2012.\n\n\nI think the idea is to—not all the time, and not with a set regularity—but I think it is critical to explore how he went from the person that he was when he left the island—which is extremely different: he's spoiled, he's entitled, he's a bit of a jerk—and he comes off it something very, very different. So we're going to explore how he gets there.\n\n\nFor the first five seasons \n features two storylines: one in the present, and the other, shown in flashback, during Oliver's time on the island five years before his rescue. These flashbacks are used to illustrate how Oliver transformed into the man that returns to Starling City.\n Filming for the island flashbacks takes place in Vancouver's Whytecliff Park area, near beachfront homes. Much planning is required to keep the buildings out of camera frame.\n Guggenheim said, \"Stephen [Amell] has to wear a wig, and his look has to be changed ... there's a lot. It's actually incredibly ambitious to do these flashbacks every week, every single episode. Because like Andrew [Kreisberg] said, it's almost like it's its own show.\"\n Regarding the flashbacks after the fifth season, Guggenheim and Mericle stated that the series would explore flashbacks from other character's perspectives, such as Curtis Holt, along with the possibility of flashforwards. Guggenheim said, \"We still want to make [flashbacks] part of our storytelling, because we do like them. We like it when those non-island flashbacks sort of illuminate what's going on in the present day. That'll always be a part of the show and a part of the show's storytelling structure. It just won't be telling a serialized story.\"\n\n\nThe series develops relationship triangles: some love triangles, others designed to catch characters in \"philosophical debates\".\n Kreisberg provides one such example: \"Every week, Oliver will be facing a bad guy, but the truth is, his real nemesis is Detective Lance, who's trying to bring him into justice... His daughter is going to be caught in the middle, because she loves and respects her father, and she's always believed in what he believed, but at the same time, she's going to see this dark urban legend out there that's actually doing a lot of good; the kind of good that she wants to be doing in her role as a legal aid attorney.\"\n Learning from previous experiences working in television, the producers worked early on identifying the major story arcs for the series, specifically the first season, including \"mapping out\" how to accomplish them. Taking inspiration from \n's \n, the creative team decided to \"put it all out there\" and \"not hold back\" from episode to episode.\n\n\nThe team strives to include various DC Comics characters and aspects of the DC universe. Guggenheim cited \n, a restaurant franchise introduced in the Superman comics, which appears in \n third episode and onward. Kreisberg said, \"There are so many characters in the DC Universe who haven't gotten their due in TV and film. We're so excited to reach into [the DC comics] roster and take some of these lesser-known characters that are beloved by fans, and do our spin on the characters.\"\n\n\nAhead of the 100th episode, Guggenheim talked about the commitment to quality the series strives for, stating, \"We never skimped on the writing, the production or in the post-process going, 'This is going to be one of those stinkers, we might as well cut our losses and move on.' We worked as hard as we possibly can on the scripts. If episodes have come in bad, we reshoot ... Even in season 5, we have no problems with doing reshoots, or pickups, or anything we need to do to make each episode as successful as it can possibly be.\" He also noted his biggest regret in the series was \"I wish we had allowed the Oliver-Felicity storyline in season 4 to unfold at a more natural pace. We had set these tentpoles at the beginning of the season, and we were a bit too rigorous on how we hit them. That was a case where the planning overtook the storytelling. We didn't do things as naturally and as elegantly as we should have.\"\n\n\nOn January 31, 2019, The CW renewed the series for an eighth season.\n On March 6, 2019, it was announced that the eighth season would be the final season of the series, with an abbreviated ten-episode run. Stephen Amell had approached Greg Berlanti towards the end of the sixth season about \"mov[ing] on\" following the expiration of his contract at the end of the seventh season. Amell had hoped that the show could go on without him, but Berlanti, Mark Guggenheim and \n decided to conclude the series with a shortened eighth season, which Amell agreed to.\n The season premiered on October 15, 2019, and concluded on January 28, 2020.\n\n\nThe realistic approach to the series included the costume design for Oliver's vigilante persona, created by \n.\n According to Amell, it was important for the suit to be functional, and the best way that he knew for that was if he could put the costume on by himself: \"If I can put it on by myself, I think that people will buy it. And that was our idea. That's our world.\"\n\n\nIn the second half of season two, Oliver dons a \n, similar to one worn by the character in the comics. Kreisberg said of the mask, \"It's actually a big plot point in an episode, and there really is a story behind, not only the need for the mask but also who provides him with it.\"\n On adding the mask now, Kreisberg stated that, \"Conceptually, it was something we wanted to do because Oliver himself is [...] stepping out of the dark and being more of a symbol, so he has to take steps to conceal his identity more.\"\n He added that it will \"allow the Arrow to interact with people who don't know his identity in a much more organic way than having him constantly keep his head down.\"\n\n\nCostume designer Maya Mani put together roughly 50 mask options for the producers. Kreisberg said, \"What's so wonderful about the design that Maya came up with is that it really is very simple, and it feels as if it's been part of his costume since the beginning ... once we finally had this mask and put it on Stephen [Amell], even Stephen was like, 'This is the right one.\n\"\n In the episode \"Three Ghosts\", Oliver receives the mask from \n, who is able to create a mask that will help conceal his identity, while still being functional and allowing Oliver to see clearly.\n\n\nTo compose the score for \n, executive producer Greg Berlanti invited \n, with whom he had first worked on \n. Neely created a score that combined electronic and orchestral cues, varying between action themes and romantic ones.\n Berlanti told Neely the series would be dark, and the music should be as well. After reading the pilot script, Neely went away to start composing on his own.\n According to Neely, \"Of course, Oliver has his main theme but also sub-themes for the many layers of his character. He and Laurel have a love theme. Mom had a theme for the Undertaking. The bad guys all have themes, which makes it sad for me when one of them dies. So I try not to become attached to bad-guy themes. Diggle has a theme. Even the Island itself has a theme.\"\n A soundtrack for season one was released on September 17, 2013, by \n.\n Two versions of a soundtrack for season two were released on September 16, 2014, by WaterTower Music and La-La Land Records; the compact disc release includes two exclusive tracks not available on the digital release.\n On December 18, 2014, WaterTower Music and La La Records released a selection of music from \n / \n crossover episodes, as well as two bonus tracks from their respective 2014 midseason finales.\n The Season 3 soundtrack was released in December 2015, consisting of 2 discs for the first time (previous albums consisted of one CD).\n\n\n premiered on The CW network from October 10, 2012, during the \n.\n In Canada, the show is \n on the same day as the United States.\n The show premiered outside North America throughout the United Kingdom and Ireland,\n on October 22, 2012.\n In Australia, the series premiered on May 1, 2013,\n on the \n, before moving to \n for Season 4.\n\n\nEach season release contains additional features, which include: making-of featurettes, episode commentaries, deleted scenes, gag reels, Comic-Con panels, and highlights from the Paley Fest. Starting with season four and continuing through each subsequent season, the boxsets included the crossover episodes from other connected series, as well as commentary on those episodes.\n\nThe first season received favorable reviews, with a \n score of 73 out of 100, based on reviews from 25 critics, making it the highest rated CW show in five years.\n Review aggregation website \n calculated an approval rating of 85%, based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 7.47/10. The site's consensus reads, \"The CW nails the target with \n, a comic book-inspired series that benefits from cinematic action sequences, strong plotting, and intriguing characters.\"\n Mary McNamara of the \n called the series an interesting setup with a quality look, describing Amell as \"a poster boy (no doubt literally) for the \n set.\"\n Brian Lowry at \n described the series as a \"handsome but stiff surrogate for \n that could benefit from sharper execution.\"\n In reviewing the final episode of season one, Alasdair Wilkins of \n gave the season as a whole a rating of B+, noting that the show \"hasn't quite figured everything out yet, but it's had some standout episodes.\"\n\n\nThe second season received acclaim from critics for the action sequences, storytelling, performances of the cast, drama, and the portrayal of Slade Wilson.\n Rotten Tomatoes reported a 95% approval rating based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 8.15/10.

The writing is adult and witty, the action is exciting, and Amell holds the center with well-cultivated ease.\"\n \ns Carrie Raisler gave the first half of season two a rating of A−. She said, \"\n [has] officially established itself as one of the most satisfying shows on television. The most satisfying thing of all is that it did so by respecting its characters ... [\n respects] the character's comic-book roots in its overarching plotlines, all while using the network-appropriate soap-opera stories to do the heavy character lifting.\"\n\n\nDespite receiving positive responses for the season three premiere,\n the second half of the season was met with criticism. The flashback sequences were characterized as sporadic and \"superfluous\", with Ra's al Ghul described as a \"shallow\" and \"underutilized\" villain \"absent of clear antagonism\",\n although Matt Nable was generally praised for his portrayal of the character. Furthermore, while parallels to \n had always existed in the show, the use of such a major character from Batman's rogues gallery and the essential application of the \"Daughter of the Demon\" and several other Batman and Ra's al Ghul storylines applied to Queen came under particular fire from viewers, who accused the show of \"ripping off\" Batman.\n The season finale was described as \"dull\", \"lacking scope\", and \"underwhelming\" by \n's Jesse Schedeen in light of the \"high standard\" the show had previously established for its finales. He cemented the mixed reception of season three as being \"haphazardly paced\" and \"struggling to develop a clear sense of direction\".\n The third season holds a score of 89% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 8.37/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\n stays on target with new characters and a steady supply of exciting action.\"\n\n\nThe fourth season received mixed reviews. The season earned praise for the action scenes and \n's performance as Damien Darhk. However, it also received increasingly negative reviews for its mundane flashbacks, lack of narrative focus, and formulaic season finale.\n Ryan Fleming of \n noted that \n was \"honoring the comics, but it isn't beholden to them. Characters ... have been introduced, but they aren't exact replicas of their comic counterparts. Instead, the characters tend to be loosely connected.\"\n Lesley Goldberg of \n noted the presence of the character Thea \"Speedy\" Queen as one of the larger departures from the comics in the series, as well as the character's early willingness to kill.\n \n' Kevin Melrose has also noted the series tendency to have loose connections to the source material.\n Rotten Tomatoes gave the season an 85% approval rating based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 7.55/10.

Guggenheim stated, \"We've tried to put in all the elements that people like about the show ... We're going to see what's happened to Detective Lance after he collapsed in the season [two] finale. A good chunk of the burning questions left over will get answered in the tie-in comic. Particularly towards the latter half of the series, we're going to start introducing characters [in the comic] who you'll see in Season 3 ... before they show up on TV.\"\n On the comic's relationship to season three of the show, Guggenheim said, \"Season three is designed to stand on its own feet without requiring anyone to do any outside reading. But what the comic book will give is a deeper appreciation for some of the moments [in the show] and a more complete narrative experience. If you want to go deeper into the story, that's what \n is for.\" Shimizu added that the comic also allows the writers to \"accomplish things on the page that are nearly impossible to do with our production schedule and our budget\", including bigger action sequences, as well as visits to locations that cannot be recreated on the show.\n The character Caleb Green, who has ties to Robert Queen, was created specifically for the comic.\n Guggenheim said \"The goal is to end \n basically five minutes before Season 3 begins.\"\n The comic launched digitally biweekly on September 1, 2014, with its first physical release featuring a collection of the digital releases releasing on October 8.\n The series featured 24 digital issues, which constituted 12 physical issues.\n\n\nA third series, \n, is written by Barrowman with his sister Carole, and with an art team led by Daniel Sampere.

Barrowman, who initially pitched the series to DC Comics as another with the ability to tell Merlyn's backstory, said he \"had a backstory in my head for Malcolm from the beginning and a lot of it has made its way into our comic, and onto the screen. I think it's always been my job to help the audience relate to Malcolm in some way despite his questionable morals and evil ways.\" Executive producers Guggenheim and Kreisberg helped the Barrowmans ensure the story would fit within the continuity of the series. The 12-chapter series was released digitally once every two weeks starting January 13, 2016, before the entire story was collected in a single print edition in September 2016.\n\n\nOn November 6, 2013, a six-episode series of shorts, titled \n, premiered alongside the broadcast of the show, as well as online.

From 1755 to 1764, the \n deported \n en masse, an event known as the \n. This, along with the \n, solidified Acadia as \n. In 1784, following the arrival of many \n fleeing the \n, the colony of New Brunswick was officially created, separating it from what is now \n.\n In the early 1800s, New Brunswick prospered and the population grew rapidly. In 1867, New Brunswick decided to join with Nova Scotia and the \n (now \n and \n) to form Canada. After \n, shipbuilding and lumbering declined, and \n disrupted trade with \n.\n\nFrom the mid-1900s onwards, New Brunswick was one of the poorest regions of Canada, a fact eventually mitigated by \n. However, the province has seen the highest eastward migration in 45 years in both rural and urban areas, as people from Ontario and other parts of Canada migrate to the area.\n As of 2002,\n the provincial GDP was derived as follows: services (about half being government services and public administration) 43%; construction, manufacturing, and utilities 24%; real estate rental 12%; wholesale and retail 11%; agriculture, forestry, fishing, hunting, mining, oil and gas extraction 5%; transportation and warehousing 5%.\n A powerful \n of large companies in New Brunswick is owned by the \n.\n The province's 2019 output was CA$38.236 billion, which is 1.65% of Canada's \n.\n\n\nTourism accounts for 9% of the labour force either directly or indirectly.

At the time of European contact, inhabitants were the \n of New Brunswick's eastern coast, the \n of the \n valley, and the \n of the \n valley. These people all lived a \n lifestyle\n. Many tribal placenames originate from their \n, such as \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\n\nThe first documented European exploration of New Brunswick was made by \n in 1534, when his party set foot in \n and explored the coasts of \n. They made contact with aboriginals, who from this point on began to trade with Europeans. This also exposed them to \n diseases.\n\n\n, a colonial division of \n covering the \n, was founded in 1604 by \n and \n with a settlement on \n. It was quickly abandoned due to difficult living conditions and moved to Acadia's capital, \n. There, the Micmacs helped the French survive. In 1626, Port-Royal was destroyed by the British. The British conquered Acadia shortly after and held it until 1629. \n, King of Scotland, renamed it \"Nova Scotia\" in English.\n\nThe Micmacs helped all French survivors, including \n. Together, they established a \n network along the \n. With the onset of the \n, de la Tour was issued a charter to govern Acadia. In 1629, Acadia was officially returned to France. As such, a new wave of French settlers arrived in Port-Royal to revitalise the colony, including \n, a new \n, and \n, his cousin. de Razilly and de la Tour's charters conflicted with each others', but the two maintained an amicable relationship. In 1635, de Razilly died, triggering tensions between de la Tour, who governed from the Saint John valley, and d'Aulnay, who governed from Port-Royal. In the 1630s, this erupted into the \n. d'Aulnay managed to expel de la Tour in 1644.

Other settlements in the southeast extended from \n, near the present-day border with Nova Scotia, to \n, and up the \n, \n, and \n Rivers.\n The descendants of Acadia's French colonists became the \n. Acadians developed a unique society characterised by dyking technology, which allowed them to cultivate marshes left by the \n's tides, and by tightly knit independent communities, because they were often neglected by French authorities.\n\n\nDuring the 1690s, in \n, attacks were launched from the Saint John valley by \n onto New England colonists. This would create a deep English hostility against the French presence in the region.\n\n\nFrom the 1600s to mid-1700s, Acadia was routinely a war zone between the French and the English and would often change hands. However, Acadia would definitively fall into British hands following \n, a conquest of most of the Acadian peninsula, formalized by the \n. After the war, Acadia was reduced to Île Saint-Jean (\n) and \n (\n), with the ownership of continental Acadia (New Brunswick) being disputed between France and Britain, with an informal border on the \n. In an effort to limit British expansion into continental Acadia, the French built \n at the isthmus in 1751. \nFrom 1749 to 1755, \n took place, where British soldiers fought against Acadians and Micmacs to consolidate their power over Acadia/Nova Scotia. In 1755, the British \n, severing the Acadian supply lines to Nova Scotia, and Île-Royale. Continental Acadia thus came to be incorporated into the British colony of Nova Scotia with the \n in 1763. Following this, the British, unsatisfied with the Acadian's surrender because they refused to pledge allegiance, turned to capturing and exporting Acadians en masse, an \n event known as the \n which was ordered by \n. From 1755 to 1763, 12,000 Acadians out of 18,000 were forcefully deported to various locations around the world, though 8000 died before arrival. The remaining 6000 Acadians escaped the British by fleeing North to the present \n, or to \n.\n From 1755 to 1757, most Acadians were deported to the \n. From 1758 to 1762, most were sent to France. Between 1763 and 1785, many deported Acadians relocated to join their compatriots in \n. Their descendants became \n. In the 1780s and 1790s, some Acadians returned to Acadia, and discovered several thousand English immigrants, mostly from New England, on their former lands.\n\n\nIn the late 1700s, the British began to make efforts to colonise the region, mostly by importing colonists from New England. Before the American Revolution, these colonists were called \n. After the revolution, the colonists were called \n, because only those loyal to the British crown settled in Nova Scotia. In 1766, planters from Pennsylvania founded \n, and English settlers from \n arrived in the \n area. In the 1770s, 10,000 loyalists settled along the north shore of the Bay of Fundy.\n In 1783, both \n and \n were founded.\n\n Loyalists who received land allocations around the St. John River valley, the Bay of Fundy or the Northumberland Strait became dissatisfied with being governed from \n because it was so far away. So, on 18 June 1784, the British government created a new province for them: New Brunswick. New Brunswick was formed from the partition of \n from the remainder of Nova Scotia.\n In that same year, New Brunswick formed its first elected assembly.\n The first governor was \n, and, in 1785, he chose the \n of Sainte-Anne as the provincial capital. Sainte-Anne was later renamed Frederick's Town (and then later \n) after the third son of \n.\n\n\nIn total, it is believed that around 14,000 loyalist refugees came to New Brunswick. However, 10% eventually returned to the United States.\n In 1785, Saint John became New Brunswick's first incorporated city.\n\n\nEconomically, New Brunswick was a poor environment for agriculture and mining. Its fishery was also far inferior to that of Nova Scotia's. New Brunswick's forests were rich in wood, but as wood is a bulky and low-value commodity, accessible markets were limited. Essentially, in the late 1700s, New Brunswick was a peripheral corner of the British Empire and North American world. Geopolitical events in Europe would change this situation. In 1806, \n's \n forced the United Kingdom, which usually relied on the \n for supplies, to import timber from its North American colonies. This stimulated the lumber trade in New Brunswick, as well as in \n.\n\n\nBetween 1805 and 1812, New Brunswick annually exported 100,000 tons of squared timber. In 1819, the number exceeded 240,000 tons, and in 1825 exports reached their highest level at 417,000 tons.\n This also resulted in the emergence of a shipbuilding market. These industries were then bolstered by the \n of 1854, and demand from the \n of 1861 to 1865. \n became the third most productive shipbuilding town in the Maritimes and produced over 500 vessels.\n\n\nFrom 1800 to 1851, New Brunswick's population grew from 25,000 to 200,000, and it saw large-scale immigration from Ireland and Scotland.\n In 1848, responsible home government was granted.\n The 1850s saw the emergence of political parties largely organised along religious and ethnic lines.\n\n\nFrom the late 1700s to mid 1800s, \n became a minority, and they lived largely on the fringes of society, fearful of the English. They were mostly illiterate due to laws preventing them from opening schools.\n They were also not part of the economic boom, and had troubles asserting their land rights.\n\n\nDuring the 1860s, the notion of unifying the maritime colonies of British North America was being increasingly discussed. This was due to multiple factors. For example, some felt that the American Civil War was the result of a weak central government and wished to avoid the same fate.\n Some also wanted to increase trade between the colonies, and be less economically tied to the US. In 1864, the \n was held to discuss a possible \n between \n, New Brunswick and \n. However, the \n, caught wind of the conference and decided to send representatives to attend. They asked that the agenda be expanded to discuss a union that would also include them.\n\nIn 1866, the United States cancelled the Reciprocity Treaty, leading to a loss of trade and a stronger desire to build up trade within British North America.\n A \n in 1866 also increased public support for a potential union.\n\n\nOn 1 July 1867, New Brunswick joined with Nova Scotia and the \n (now Ontario and Quebec) to create the Dominion of Canada.\n\nThough Confederation brought into existence the \n in 1872, new barriers undermined traditional trade relations. In 1879, \n's \n enacted the \n, which called for high tariffs and opposed \n, disrupting the trading relationship between the Maritimes and \n. The economic situation was worsened by the \n of 1877, the decline of the shipbuilding industry, and the US \n. Many experienced workers lost their jobs and had to move west or to the United States.\n\nIn 1871, the government introduced free education, banning \n, the \n and French in public schools in the process. Though contested by the Acadians and the Irish, the law was deemed constitutional. Following a riot in \n in 1875, and political pressure, the bans were lifted in 1877.\n\n\nThe \n, founded by the \n, officially began in 1881 in \n when James Irving bought a sawmill.\n Afterwars, the family continued to acquire businesses and substantial wealth, eventually becoming the richest family in the province. Today, Irving is considered by many to exert a monopoly over New Brunswick.\n\n\nTowards the early 20th century, the economy began to improve somewhat. The railways and tariffs fostered the growth of new industries in the province such as textile manufacturing, iron mills, \n, and sugar refineries.\n However, many of these eventually failed to compete with their competition in Central Canada. Unemployement was high for a long time and increased during the \n of the 1930s.\n\nBy the end of the Great Depression, the New Brunswick standard of living was much lower than the Canadian average. In 1937, New Brunswick had the highest infant mortality and illiteracy rates in Canada.\n In 1940, the \n reported grave flaws in the Canadian constitution. While the federal government had most of the revenue gathering powers, the provinces had many expenditure responsibilities such as healthcare, education, and welfare, which were becoming increasingly expensive. The Commission recommended the creation of \n, which were eventually implemented in 1957.\n\nAfter Canada joined \n, 14 NB army units were organized, in addition to \n,\n and first deployed in the \n in 1943. After the \n they redeployed to northwestern Europe, along with \n.\n The \n, a training program for ally pilots, established bases in Moncton, \n, and \n, as well as a military typing school in Saint John. While relatively unindustrialized before the war, New Brunswick became home to 34 plants on military contracts from which the province received over $78 million.\n \n, who had promised no conscription, asked the provinces if they would release the government of said promise. New Brunswick voted 69.1% yes. The policy was not implemented until 1944, too late for many of the conscripts to be deployed.\n There were 1808 NB fatalities among the armed forces.\n\n\nThe Acadians in northern New Brunswick had long been geographically and linguistically isolated from the more numerous English speakers to the south. The population of French origin grew dramatically after Confederation, from about 16 per cent in 1871 to 34 per cent in 1931.\n Government services were often not available in French, and the infrastructure in Francophone areas was less developed than elsewhere. In 1960 Premier \n embarked on the \n, in which education, rural road maintenance, and healthcare fell under the sole jurisdiction of a provincial government that insisted on equal coverage throughout the province, rather than the former county-based system. In 1969 the Robichaud government adopted the Official Languages Act making the province officially bilingual and establishing the right of New Brunswickers to obtain provincial government services in the official language of their choice. In 1982 at the request of the government of \n, this right became part of the \n and therefore part of the \n.\n\n\nThe \n, based on the coat of arms, was adopted in 1965. The conventional heraldic representations of a lion and a ship represent colonial ties with Europe, and the importance of shipping at the time the coat of arms was assigned.\n\n\nRoughly square, New Brunswick is bordered on the north by Quebec, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Bay of Fundy, and on the west by the US state of \n. The southeast corner of the province is connected to Nova Scotia at the \n of Chignecto.\n\nGlaciation has left much of New Brunswick's uplands with only shallow, acidic soils which have discouraged settlement but which are home to enormous forests.\n\n\nNew Brunswick's climate is more severe than that of the other Maritime provinces, which are lower and have more shoreline along the moderating sea. New Brunswick has a \n, with slightly milder winters on the Gulf of St. Lawrence coastline. Elevated parts of the far north of the province have a \n.\n\nEvidence of \n in New Brunswick can be seen in its more intense precipitation events, more frequent winter \n, and one quarter to half the amount of \n.\n Today, the sea level is about 30 cm (1 ft) higher than it was 100 years ago, and it is expected to rise twice that much again by the year 2100.\n\n\nMost of New Brunswick\n is forested with \n or tertiary forest. At the start of European settlement, the Maritimes were covered from coast to coast by a forest of mature trees, giants by today's standards. Today less than one per cent of old-growth \n remains,\n and the \n lists the Acadian Forest as endangered.\n Following the frequent large scale disturbances caused by settlement and timber harvesting, the Acadian forest is not growing back as it was, but is subject to borealization. This means that exposure-resistant species that are well adapted to the frequent large-scale disturbances common in the boreal forest are increasingly abundant. These include \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n Forest ecosystems support large carnivores such as the \n, \n, and \n, and the large herbivores \n and \n.\n\n are harvested from the \n which grows on riverbanks. \n, a \n \n \n to the shores of the upper Saint John River, is an \n threatened by habitat destruction, riverside development, forestry, littering and recreational use of the riverbank.\n Many \n are being disrupted by the highly invasive \n \n.\n\n\nThe \n population in the province has dropped by 70% since 1985. The widespread use of \n may have contributed to this.\n\n\nSince 2014, the New Brunswick government has allowed forestry companies to harvest 20 percent more wood there than before.\n\n\nBedrock types range from 1 billion to 200 million years old.\n\nMuch of the bedrock in the west and north derives from ocean deposits in the \n that were subject to \n and \n \n and that were eventually covered with lava during the \n, peaking during the \n.\n\n\nDuring the \n period, about 340 million years ago, New Brunswick was in the \n, a \n near the equator. Sediments, brought by rivers from surrounding highlands, accumulated there; after being compressed, they produced the Albert \n of southern New Brunswick. Eventually, sea water from the \n invaded the basin, forming the Windsor Sea. Once this receded, \n, \n, and \n accumulated. The \n colour of these was caused by the oxidation of iron in the beds between wet and dry periods.\n Such late Carboniferous rock formed the \n, which have been shaped by the extreme \n of the Bay of Fundy.\n\nIn the early \n, as \n drifted north it was rent apart, forming the \n that is the Bay of Fundy. \n pushed up through the cracks, forming \n columns on \n.\n\n\nNew Brunswick lies entirely within the \n. The \n drain into either the \n to the east or the \n to the south. These watersheds include lands in Quebec and Maine.\n\n\nNew Brunswick and the rest of the \n was covered by thick layers of ice during the last glacial period (the \n).\n It cut \n in the Saint John and \n valleys and pushed \n boulders from the Miramichi highlands south and east, leaving them as \n when the ice receded at the end of the \n, along with deposits such as the \n between Woodstock and St George, which are today sources of sand and gravel.\n\nThe four \n are Canada's least populated, with New Brunswick the \n at 775,610 in 2021, up 3.8% since 2016.\n A more recent estimate is that the population surpassed 800,000 in March 2022.\n\n\nThe Atlantic provinces also have higher rural populations. New Brunswick was largely rural until 1951; since then, the rural-urban split has been roughly even.\n Population density in the Maritimes is above average among Canadian provinces; this reflects their small size and the fact that they do not possess large, unpopulated hinterlands like the other seven provinces and three territories.\n\nNew Brunswick's 107 municipalities\n cover \n8.6% of the province's land mass but are home to \n65.3% of its population. The three major urban areas are in the south of the province and are \n, population 157,717, \n, population 130,613, and \n, population 108,610.\n\nIn the 2001 census, the most commonly reported ethnicities were British 40%, \n and \n 31%, Irish 18%, other European 7%, \n 3%, \n 2%. Each person could choose more than one ethnicity.\n\n\nAs of the \n, the most spoken languages in the province included English (698,025 or 91.94%), French (317,825 or 41.86%), Spanish (7,580 or 1%), Arabic (6,090 or 0.8%), Tagalog (4,225 or 0.56%), and Hindi (3,745 or 0.49%).\n The question on knowledge of languages allows for multiple responses.\n\nAccording to the \n in the Canadian Constitution, both English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick,\n making it the only officially bilingual province. Government and public services are available in both English and French.\n\nFor education, English-language and French-language systems serve the two linguistic communities at all levels.\n Anglophone New Brunswickers make up roughly two-thirds of the population, while about one-third are Francophone. Recently there has been growth in the numbers of people reporting themselves as bilingual, with 34% reporting that they speak both English and French. This reflects a trend across Canada.\n\n\nAccording to the \n, religious groups in New Brunswick included:\n\n\nIn the 2011 census, 84% of provincial residents reported themselves as Christian:\n 52% were \n, 8% \n, 8% \n, 7% \n and 9% other \n. 15% percent of residents reported no religion.\n\nAs of October 2017, seasonally adjusted employment is 73,400 for the goods-producing sector and 280,900 for the services-producing sector. Those in the goods-producing industries are mostly employed in manufacturing or construction, while those in services work in social assistance, trades, and health care.\n A large portion of the economy is controlled by the \n, which consists of the holdings of the family of \n. The companies have significant holdings in agriculture, \n, \n, \n (including railways and trucking), media, \n, and \n.\n\n\nThe influence of the Irving family on New Brunswick is such that the province is sometimes described as being subject to a form of economic \n. In 2016, the 200 or so companies it controls gave it about $10 billion in capital.\n The group's activities are supported by the authorities through numerous tax exemptions and the payment of subsidies, notably through the Renewable Energy Purchase Program for Large Industry. The province has also progressively handed over the management of the public sector forestry assets to the Irving Group, regularly lowering standards. In 2014, the latter reduced the size of buffer zones between forests and human settlements, allowed more \n, increased the planned production volume and reduced the proportion of protected areas from 31% to 22%.\n\n\nThrough \n the family owns several local radio stations. The family owned all the province's English-language newspapers through \n until its sale to \n in 2022.\n For academic \n, \"the conflicts of interest that arise from this situation seem caricatural: the group's media essentially echo the positions of the Irving family in all the fields of social and industrial life in which it is involved.\" The information transmitted by the group and disseminated by the press is sometimes questioned (notably in the fall of 2018, during an explosion at the Saint John refinery), but few public officials, professors and members of parliament carry denunciations, as the family's financial contributions to universities and political parties provide it with leverage.\n\n\nThe United States is the province's largest export market, accounting for 92% of a foreign trade valued in 2014 at almost $13 billion, with refined petroleum making up 63% of that, followed by seafood products, pulp, paper and sawmill products and non-metallic minerals (chiefly potash). The value of exports, mostly to the United States, was $1.6 billion in 2016. About half of that came from lobster. Other products include salmon, crab, and herring.\n In 2015, spending on non-resident \n was $441 million, which provided $87 million in tax revenue.\n\n\nBiologists, academics and Eilish Cleary, the province's former head of public health, have reported being subjected to intense pressure (including dismissal in Cleary's case) while analyzing the impact of the company's pesticides and its opaque forest management. Since the 1970s, every premier in the province has been elected with the support of Irving. \n, premier since November 2018, is a former executive of the group. According to journalist \n: \"We might be able to win an election without Irving's tacit support, but we could hardly aspire to power if he decided to openly oppose it.\"\n\n\nA large number of residents from New Brunswick are employed in the \n. More than 13,000 New Brunswickers work in agriculture, shipping products worth over $1 billion, half of which is from crops, and half of that from potatoes, mostly in the Saint John River valley. \n is one of the world's largest manufacturers of frozen potato products. Other products include apples, \n, and \n.\n New Brunswick was in 2015 the biggest producer of wild \n in Canada.\n The value of the livestock sector is about a quarter of a billion dollars, nearly half of which is dairy. Other sectors include poultry, fur, and goats, sheep, and pigs.\n\nAbout 85 to 90% of New Brunswick is forested. Historically important, it accounted for more than 80% of exports in the mid-1800s. By the end of the 1800s the industry, and shipbuilding, were declining due to external economic factors. The 1920s saw the development of a pulp and paper industry. In the mid-1960s, forestry practices changed from the controlled harvests of a commodity to the cultivation of the forests.\n The industry employs nearly 12,000, generating revenues around $437 million.\n\n\nMining was historically unimportant in the province, but has grown since the 1950s.\n The province's GDP from the Mining and Quarrying industry in 2015 was $299.5 million.\n \n produce lead, zinc, copper, and potash.\n\nForest management in the province is particularly opaque. Donald Bowser, an international expert on political corruption, says he is \"shocked to discover that there is less transparency in New Brunswick than in \n, \n or \n, despite the huge public funds committed to natural resource development.\n\n\n elementary and secondary education in the province is administered by the provincial \n. New Brunswick has a parallel system of Anglophone and Francophone \n. In the anglophone system, approximately 27 per cent of the students are enrolled in a \n programs.\n\n\nThe province also operates five public \n, including four public universities and one \n. Four public universities operate campuses in New Brunswick, including the oldest English-language university in the country, the \n. Other English-language public universities include \n and \n. \n is the province's only French-language university. All four universities offer \n, and \n. Additionally, the Université de Moncton and the University of New Brunswick also provide \n.\n\nPublic colleges in the province are managed as a part of the \n (NBCC) system, except for the \n,\n which has operated through the Department of Post-Secondary Education, Training and Labour since 1938. In addition to public institutions, the province is also home to several private \n, such as the \n; and universities, the largest being \n.\n\nUnder \n, power is divided between federal and provincial governments. Among areas under federal jurisdiction are citizenship, foreign affairs, national defence, fisheries, criminal law, Indigenous policies, and many others. Provincial jurisdiction covers public lands, health, education, and local government, among other things. Jurisdiction is shared for immigration, pensions, agriculture, and welfare.\n\n\nThe parliamentary system of government is modelled on the British \n. Forty-nine representatives, nearly always members of political parties, are elected to the \n. The \n is the \n, normally the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the legislative assembly. Governance is handled by the \n (cabinet), with about 32 ministries.\n Ceremonial duties of the \n are mostly carried out by the \n.\n\nUnder amendments to the province's Legislative Assembly Act in 2007, a provincial election is held every four years. The two largest political parties are the \n and the \n. Since the \n, minor parties are the \n and the \n.\n\nThe \n of New Brunswick is the highest provincial court. It hears appeals from:\n\nThe system consists of eight Judicial Districts, loosely based on the counties.\n The \n serves at the apex of this court structure.\n\nHistorically \n with elected governance, but this was abolished in 1966. While county governments have been abolished in New Brunswick, counties continue to be used as \n by \n, and as an organizational unit, along with parishes, for registration of real-estate and its taxation. Counties continue to figure into the sense of identity of many New Brunwickers. Counties are further subdivided into \n, which also lost their political significance in 1966 but are still used as \n by \n.\n\nNinety-two per cent of the land in the province, inhabited by about 35% of the population, is under provincial administration and has no local, elected representation. The 51% of the province that is \n is administered by the \n.\n\nMost of the province is administrated as a \n, an unincorporated unit of local governance. As of 2017, there are 237 LSDs. Services, paid for by property taxes, include a variety of services such as fire protection, solid waste management, street lighting, and dog regulation. LSDs may elect advisory committees\n and work with the \n to recommend how to spend locally collected taxes.\n\nIn 2006 there were three rural communities. This is a relatively new type of entity; to be created, it requires a population of 3,000 and a tax base of $200 million.\n In 2006 there were 101 municipalities.\n\n, which number 12, were introduced in 2013 to regulate regional planning and solid waste disposal, and provide a forum for discussion on a regional level of police and emergency services, \n planning, and regional sport, recreational and cultural facilities. The commissions' administrative councils are populated by the mayors of each municipality or rural community within a region.\n\n\nIn 2015, New Brunswick had the most poorly-performing economy of any Canadian province, with a per capita income of $28,000.\n The government has historically run at a large deficit. With about half of the population being rural, it is expensive for the government to provide education and health services, which account for 60 per cent of government expenditure. Thirty-six per cent of the provincial budget is covered by federal cash transfers.\n\n\nThe government has frequently attempted to create employment through subsidies, which has often failed to generate long-term economic prosperity and has resulted in bad debt,\n examples of which include \n, Atcon,\n and the Marriott call centre in Fredericton.\n\n\nAccording to a 2014 study by the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, the large public debt is a very serious problem. Government revenues are shrinking because of a decline in federal transfer payments. Though expenditures are down (through government pension reform and a reduction in the number of public employees), they have increased relative to GDP,\n necessitating further measures to reduce debt in the future.\n\nIn the 2014–15 \n, provincial debt reached $12.2 billion or 37.7 per cent of nominal GDP, an increase over the $10.1 billion recorded in 2011–12.\n The \n is projected to fall to 36.7% in 2019–20.\n\n\nEnergy capacity by source in NB:\n\nPublicly owned \n operates 13 of \n, deriving power from fuel oil and diesel (1497 MW), hydro (889 MW), nuclear (660 MW), and coal (467 MW). There were 30 active natural gas production sites in 2012.\n\n\nNew Brunswickers are entitled to the universal and government-funded healthcare operated by the \n. They can use their Medicare card to get this care or receive care in another province. New Brunswick is divided into 2 health care regions: Vitalité Health Network and Horizon Health Network. There also exists 2 confidential health information lines: 911 (for emergencies) and 811 (for non-urgent health questions).\n\n\nFinding a family doctor is important for all New Brunswickers, but it has become difficult over the last decade. Patient Connect NB is a provincially managed, bilingual patient registry that matches New Brunswickers with a family doctor or nurse practitioner on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n As of 2022, this registry lists at 74,000 people waiting to be matched.\n\n\nHealth care services not covered by the government include: dentists, optometrists, retirement homes, mental health services, private clinics, and health insurance.\n\nThe \n maintains government facilities and the province's highway network and ferries. The \n is not under federal jurisdiction, and traverses the province from \n following the Saint John River Valley, through Fredericton, Moncton, and on to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.\n\n's \n service, which connects \n to \n, is currently the oldest continuously operated passenger route in North America, with stops from west to east at \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n\n operates freight services along the same route, as well as a subdivision from Moncton to Saint John. The \n, a division of \n, together with its sister company \n form a continuous 305 km (190 mi) main line connecting Saint John and \n, Maine.\n\nThere are about 61 \n, including Fort Beauséjour, \n and the \n. Established in 1842, the \n in Saint John was designated as the \n of New Brunswick. The province is also home to a \n in addition to the provincial museum.\n\nThe \n includes artists such as \n, \n, \n, and \n. \n, based in Saint John, tours extensively in the province. \n and the \n tours nationally and internationally.\n\n tours plays around the province. Canadian playwright \n saw his early works premiere with Theatre New Brunswick. Other theatres of the province include the Théatre populaire d'Acadie in \n, the \n in Sackville, the \n in Saint John, the \n theatre in Moncton, and the \n theatre in Fredericton.\n\nNew Brunswick is home to many galleries across the province, including the \n, which was designated as New Brunswick's provincial art gallery in 1994, and the Galerie d’art Louise-et-Reuben-Cohen at the \n.\n New Brunswick also has four \n: Connexion ARC located in Fredericton, Galerie Sans Nom in Moncton, Struts Gallery in Sackville, and Third Space Gallery in Saint John, as well as one artist-run printshop, Atelier d'estampe Imago Inc., located in Moncton.\n\n\n is known for its art program, which was created in 1854. The program came into its own under \n, from 1893 to 1916. Notable graduates include \n, \n, \n, and \n. The university also opened an art gallery in 1895 and is named for its patron, John Owens of Saint John. The Owens Art Gallery at Mount Allison University is presently the oldest \n in Canada.\n\nModern New Brunswick artists include landscape painter \n, sculptor \n, and \n.\n\n, born in Fredericton, was Canada's first published novelist. Poet \n and his cousin \n were some of the first Canadians to achieve international fame for letters. \n was the first non-European winner of France's \n. Other modern writers include \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n. A recent New Brunswick Lieutenant-Governor, \n, is a poet and playwright. \n, established in 1945 at University of New Brunswick, is Canada's oldest literary magazine.\n\nNew Brunswick has four daily newspapers: the \n, serving eastern New Brunswick; the \n, based in Saint John and distributed province-wide; \n, based in Fredericton; and \n, based in Caraquet. The three English-language dailies and the majority of the weeklies are owned and operated by \n—which is privately owned by \n. Due to its dominant position, critics have accused Brunswick News of being biased towards the Irving Group of Companies, noting its reluctance to publish stories that are critical of the group.\n\n\nThe \n has anglophone television and radio operations in Fredericton. \n is based in Moncton. \n and \n also operate stations in New Brunswick, which operate largely as sub-feeds of their stations in Halifax as part of regional networks.\n\nThere are \n licensed in New Brunswick, broadcasting in English or French.\n\n"},

In the \n the displacement is mainly taken up along the \n, although the remaining dextral strike-slip component of the relative plate motion is accommodated by the \n (NIFS).\n\n\nThe earthquake is thought to have occurred on one of the larger \n faults within the \n, at between ca. 5 km depth and ca. 20–25 km depth (which is the approximate depth of subducted Pacific plate at that location).\n\n\nNearly all buildings in the central areas of Napier and Hastings were levelled (\n noted that \"Napier as a town has been wiped off the map\")\n and the death toll included 161 people in \n, 93 in \n, and two in \n.\n Thousands more were injured, with over 400 hospitalised.\n\nThe local landscape changed dramatically, with the coastal areas around Napier being lifted by around two metres.\n The most noticeable land change was the uplifting of some 40 km\n of sea-bed to become dry land.  This included \n, which was lifted more than 2.7 metres\n and resulted in draining 2230 hectares of the lagoon. Today, this area is the location of \n, housing and industrial developments and farmland.\n\nWithin minutes fires broke out in chemist shops in Hastings Street, Napier. The fire brigade almost had the first fire under control when the second broke out in a shop at the back of the Masonic Hotel. The hotel was quickly engulfed in flames. The wind at this point also picked up strength and began blowing from the east, pushing the fires back over the city. With water mains broken, the brigade was unable to save many buildings. Pumping water from Clive Square, they were able to stop the fires spreading south. Only a few buildings in the central Napier area survived. Some withstood the earthquake only to be gutted by fire. Trapped people had to be left to burn as people were unable to free them in time. By Wednesday morning, the main fires were out, but the ruins still smouldered for several days.\n\nIn Hastings, the fires were quickly brought under control.\n\nThe death toll might have been much higher had the \n ship \n not been in port at the time. Within minutes of the shock the \n had sent radio messages asking for help. The sailors joined survivors to fight the fires, rescue trapped people and help give them medical treatment. The \ns radio was used to transmit news of the disaster to the outside world and to seek assistance. The crew from two cargo ships, the \n and \n, also joined the rescue works, while two cruisers, \n and \n, were dispatched from Auckland that afternoon with food, tents, medicine, blankets, and a team of doctors and nurses. The cruisers sailed at high speed overnight, arrived on 4 February and provided valuable assistance in all areas until their departure on 11 February.\n\nA group of prisoners working at Bluff Hill in Napier had four of their number buried in a landslip by the quake. The remaining prisoners dug them out, but two had been killed. The prisoners re-assembled without any attempt to escape and were locked up in the Napier Jail. In \n, \n missionaries' accommodation block had been built and opened in February 1931. The next day the Hawke's Bay earthquake struck, causing serious damage to the entire Mission. Two priests and seven students were killed when the stone chapel was destroyed. In \n, St Luke's church was damaged (but not destroyed) just before a wedding was due to take place. The couple got married later in the day, but outdoors.\n\nThe entire east coast of the North Island lost electricity during the quake, although power was restored to \n, \n, \n and \n within two hours, and to \n within ten hours. At Napier substation, the transformers were tipped over by the force of the quake and the high-voltage switchgear damaged, while the Napier to \n transmission line was taken out of service after a landslide caused a tower to collapse. A limited supply was restored to Napier and Hastings on 4 February; due to the damage at Napier substation, the Waipukurau to Napier transmission line was jumpered to the low-voltage switchgear at both ends. The Napier to Tuai line was repaired and put back into service on 12 February, while full supply to Napier substation was restored on 29 March.\n\n\nWithin four days of the quake, cinemas around New Zealand offered news specials about the disaster.\n\nAnother service affected by the earthquake was the Napier \n. The tracks were twisted by the earthquake, and were never restored.\n\n\nNew Zealand's first commercial air disaster occurred six days after the quake, when a \n \n monoplane crashed near Wairoa. The small airline had been making three return trips a day between Hastings and Gisborne, carrying passengers and supplies. All three on board were killed.\n\n\nThe Napier \n had recently celebrated its diamond jubilee with an article describing Napier as \"the \n of the Pacific\". The newspaper office was destroyed by the quake. The \n offices in Hastings were also destroyed.\n\n was destroyed in the earthquakes, which caused it to be disestablished and amalgamated into \n and \n.\n\n\nOn 13 February, Hawke's Bay was struck by a 7.3 M\n  aftershock. At the time, this second event was New Zealand's fourth strongest recorded earthquake. Author Matthew Wright reported that \"the power failed three seconds before the earthquake was felt in Napier. People from Napier to \n ran for their lives as previously damaged buildings cracked and fell\".\n He added \"Some inland parts of Hawke's Bay felt this aftershock more strongly than 3 February quake. In Taupo, goods were thrown from shop shelves, but 'there was no damage of any moment'. People rushed into the streets in Dannevirke and Masterton. In Wellington all but one of the clocks stopped working in the Dominion Observatory, and ceiling lights in the Evening Post offices swayed 'more vigorously' than they had the week before\".\n\nThe earthquake of 13 February 1931 is widely regarded as an aftershock of the larger event ten days earlier. But Messrs Adams, Barnett and Hayes commenting on the rapid decline in the frequency of aftershocks in the Journal of Science & Technology stated, \"The fresh outbreak on the 13th February, due to the severe shock on that date, may almost be regarded as a separate disturbance, although it probably arose from conditions produced by the original shock on the 3rd\".\n\nAftershocks continued to shake Hawke's Bay frequently until July 1931, where the average aftershock occurrence dropped to less than one daily. Aftershocks continued for several years, with the last major jolt shaking the Bay in April 1934.\n\nBelow is a list of all recorded aftershocks following the main event.\n\nIn all, 597 earthquakes were recorded at Hastings in February 1931, and more than 900 by the end of December 1931.\n\n\nThe government quickly realised that the Napier borough council would be overwhelmed with organising the rebuild and appointed two commissioners for this task, \n and Lachlan Bain Campbell.\n When the commissioners were due to leave in May 1933, they were petitioned to stay, and Barton was invited to stand for the mayoralty, which he declined.\n\n\nThe earthquake prompted a thorough review of New Zealand \n, which were found to be totally inadequate.\n Many buildings built during the 1930s and 1940s are heavily reinforced, although more recent research has developed other strengthening techniques. Building regulations established as a result of this event mean that to this day, there are only four buildings in Hawke's Bay taller than five storeys, and as most of the region's rebuilding took place in the 1930s when \n was fashionable, Hawke's Bay architecture is regarded today as being one of the finest collections of Art Deco in the world.\n\n\nOn the tenth anniversary of the earthquake, the \n reported that Napier had risen from the ashes like a phoenix. It quoted the 1931 principal of \n as saying \"Napier today is a far lovelier city than it was before\".\n"},
{"title": "Napier Technical College (New Zealand) - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\n was a \n in \n, New Zealand.\n Established in 1909, it provided general secondary education during the day and trade skills in the evening. After the \n caused severe damage to the technical college's buildings and killed nine students, the school was disestablished and amalgamated into \n and \n.\n\nBefore the earthquake, the technical college suffered overcrowding due to increasing enrolments and a lack of space to erect new buildings. Consequently, development of a new site in Napier began in 1930, but due to the earthquake, the move there was never completed. \n now occupies the site.\n\nNapier Technical College was established in 1909, replacing the Technical Institute. It taught both boys and girls, which provided general secondary education during the day, and taught trade skills during night school.\n In 1908 the technical college had an enrolment of 80 students.\n An example of a class held in the technical college was one that taught machine sheep-shearing, wool sorting and \n.\n\n\nThe engineering department building of the technical college was completed in 1911.\n Four years later in 1915, after a £250 grant\n and a £660 tender,\n The Honourable \n opened the technical college's gymnasium which also served as a social hall.\n The electric work and lighting was done by the students.\n\n\nBy 1923 the technical college had an enrolment of 250 students and taught classes including agriculture, engineering, home science and commercial.\n That year, due to regulations, a third of the board was randomly selected to step down.\n\n\nWith an increasing enrolment from 80 in 1908 to 256 in 1919, the technical college started to become overcrowded. Because of this, it had to start teaching classes of students in practical classrooms rather than using them for physical training. There was no room to erect more buildings as the technical college was on a quarter acre section.\n\n\nIn 1919 architect \n was appointed to design a new college building.\n The \n later decided that it would donate land, adjoin properties and close a road, making the site for the technical college approximately five acres.\n After what was described as a \"standstill\" in 1925,\n in August 1929 the Minister of Education approved a grant for building the first part of the new college.\n After a delay,\n the \n was laid on 18 August 1930 by Minister of Education the Honourable \n.\n In January 1931 the first part of the new building was described as almost complete.\n The technical college was never moved to this building due to the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake.\n It was two storeys high and had red bricks.\n\n\nOn 1 March 1931 the technical college had an enrolment of 1008, of which, 605 were boys and 403 were girls.\n\n\nOn 3 February 1931, the magnitude 7.8 \n occurred, which destroyed the technical college, and killed nine students.\n The first earthquake caused parts of the outer brick walls to fall out onto the street, and the second earthquake caused the first floor to collapse on the ground floor classrooms.\n The earthquake occurred after recess on the first day of the school year.\n Some senior boys went back into the classrooms to rescue trapped classmates.\n It took two hours to get the students out.\n\n\nAfter the earthquakes, several teachers were moved to other schools in the country,\n and students were temporarily taught by the principal under a marquee in \n.\n The technical college was never rebuilt.\n After opposition and lobbying from the board of directors, the minister of education disestablished Napier Technical College and amalgamated it with \n and \n, which were the technical college's rivals.\n\n\nIn 1935 a proposal was made to place a memorial on the technical college's former land to remember the students who died there.\n\n\n has a set of the school's uniform: a shirt, cap and pair of shorts. These were taken from student Harry Pond as he was being rescued from the collapsed building.\n\n\nIn 1921 the cricket club Napier Technical College Old Boys was started, which still runs to this day, now named Napier Technical Old Boys.\n The technical college's band also still exists, now named the Napier Technical Memorial Band.\n Napier Technical College was the first day-school to have a band.\n\n\nIn 1960 New Zealand artist \n created a mural in the Napier Girls' High School to remember the earthquake and merger between the two schools. It has Napier Technical College's crest, uniform, and motto, which was \n, meaning \"to work is to pray\".\n\n\nIn May 2014 Historic Places Aotearoa placed an information panel on Napier Technical College's first site, on the corner of Munroe and Station Street. The land is mostly now used as a \n supermarket.\n\n\nThe main block of \n was built on the foundations of what was the new building of Napier Technical College.\n\n"},

Working on existing articles is a good way to learn our protocols and \n; see the \n for articles that need your assistance and tasks you can help out with.\n\nWikipedia is an \n written by volunteers to help people gain useful knowledge. Our encyclopedia is pretty comprehensive, but that does not mean we would cover \n topic that exists. Wikipedia is \n a \n, a \n or \n, nor a place to announce \n. Information from websites, blogs, forum posts, social media, \n, including \n, and \n are generally not suitable for Wikipedia.\n\nOur job is to \n high-quality and published sources from other places, in the form of Wikipedia articles. That really is all we do! Do make sure that anything you write on Wikipedia is based \n on such sources.\n\nMany of the notable topics have already been written by people in the past, and the fact of the matter is, most new articles nowadays are written about fairly obscure subjects. That can make distinguishing topics that are suitable or not suitable on Wikipedia very difficult, and are often \n. \n. More than 200 articles are deleted from the English Wikipedia every day; most are deleted for this very reason. We don't want you to waste all of your effort just for it to be marked for deletion!\n\n, meaning that you have a close connection to the subject as an employee, family member, friend, etc. or your financial and other relationships. This is a very strict policy on Wikipedia. In practice, articles created out of a conflict of interest are usually rejected or deleted on sight. (Further information: \n)\n\nIf you want to succeed at this endeavor, you should gain ample experience beforehand and get a feel for what would be a 'suitable' topic to write on Wikipedia. Because the stakes are lower, this is a perfect opportunity to hone your editing skills! Take a tour through the \n, ask around at the \n, or read \n. Don't be disappointed if you couldn't find a new topic to write for Wikipedia; plenty of distinguished contributors here have only edited existing articles; you could be the one to turn a rubbish article into a great one.\n\nBefore creating an article, try to make sure there is not already an article on the same topic. If you don't find a match, perhaps try using a slightly different or broader search term: (Tip: If you want to write an article about a band member, you might search for the band and then add information about your subject as a \n within that broader article.)\n\n\n\nBefore beginning to write any of your first article, gather sources for the information you will be writing about. You will use references to establish notability and to cite particular facts. References used to establish notability must meet \n beyond reliability. References used for specific facts need not meet these additional criteria.\n\nTo be suitable for inclusion in an encyclopedia, a subject must have \n. All information in encyclopedia articles must be \n through \n.\n\nAs noted, the sources you use must be \n: they must be sources that exercise some form of editorial control and have some reputation for fact-checking and accuracy. Print sources (and web-based versions of those sources) tend to be the most reliable. Examples include: books published by major publishing houses, newspapers, magazines, peer-reviewed scholarly journals, websites of any of the above, and other websites that meet the same requirements as a reputable print-based source.\n\nIn general, sources with \n editorial control are not reliable. These include (but are not limited to) books published by vanity presses, blogs, web forums, Reddit discussions, personal social media, fan sites, and other similar venues. If anyone at all can post information without anyone else checking that information, it is probably not reliable. Similarly, an opinion column in an otherwise reputable newspaper cannot help establish notability.\n\nMany web sources feature \n. This anyone can sign up and create content. All wikis are like this, including Wikipedia. Also IMDb, Goodreads, YouTube, LinkedIn, and social media such as Twitter and Instagram. Except for a few specific exceptions, these sources cannot be used. \n\nA good resource for determining the quality of a source is \n. This does not list things like books, or extremely reputable sources which are never questioned, like the Associated Press. It does list many sources that have been debated frequently. If your source is listed on that page as \"generally unreliable\" or \"deprecated\", you should not use it in your article.\n\nSources used to establish notability must additionally be \n: they must not be connected to the subject. A company's own website cannot help establish notability. An interview with someone cannot help establish notability, as these can be bought. A press release repackaged as a news item (\n) cannot help either, and is sometimes more difficult to spot. Articles in \n magazine whose author is listed as a \"\n contributor\" are the equivalent of an opinion column, usually paid for by a business or individual with the intent of self-promotion.\n\nSources used to establish notability must additionally demonstrate \n: they must discuss your subject for a while, at least multiple paragraphs. A mention in one or two sentences, or the appearance of your subject in a table or list is not enough to help establish notability.\n\nSources that are not independent of the subject or do not demonstrate significant coverage can still be used in your article to support factual claims, but do not count towards notability. Sources that are not reliable should not be used at all.\n\nIf there are reliable independent sources (such as newspapers, journals, or books) with extensive information published over an extended period about a subject, then that subject is notable. You must cite such sources as part of the process of creating a Wikipedia article as evidence of notability for evaluation by other editors. If you cannot find such \n that provide extensive information about your proposed subject, then the subject is not notable or verifiable and almost certainly will be declined or deleted. \n\nIf none of your sources are reliable and independent while providing significant coverage, it doesn't matter how many you have. No amount of these is enough to establish notability. Adding many inadequate sources will not help your article get approved, and will delay review as reviewers struggle to check them all. \n\nSo your first job is to \n to cite. There are many places to find reliable sources, including your local library, but if internet-based sources are to be used, start with \n and \n searches rather than a web search.\n\nOnce you have references for your article, you can learn to place the references into the article by reading \n and \n. If you are using the \n, it can automatically generate citations for you if you tap the quotation mark icon and feed it a link to a webpage. Please double check these, as they sometimes contain errors or lack important information, such as author and publication date. You can toggle between the Visual and Source editors by tapping the pencil / eyeball icon in the upper right corner of the editing area.\n\nAs a general rule, \n. \n\n\n1. have a reputation for reliability: they are \n\n2. are independent of the subject\n\n3. are \n by other editors\n\nWikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit, but there are special guidelines for editors who are paid or sponsored. These guidelines are intended to prevent biased articles and maintain the public's trust that content in Wikipedia is impartial and has been added in good faith. \n\nThe official guideline is that editors \n That means Wikipedia discourages editing articles about individuals, companies, organizations, products/services, or political causes that pay you directly or indirectly. This includes in-house PR departments and marketing departments, other company employees, \n firms and publicists, social-media consultants, and \n consultants. However, Wikipedia recognizes the large volume of good-faith contributions by people who have some affiliation to the articles they work on.\n\nHere are some ground rules. Note that this is not necessarily a full list, so use \n when applying these rules. If you break these rules or game the system, your edits are likely to be reverted, and the article(s) and your other edits may get extra scrutiny from other Wikipedia editors. Your account may also be blocked.\n\nNote that this only covers conflicts of interest. Editors are encouraged to write on topics related to their expertise: e.g., a NASA engineer might write about Jupiter, or an English professor might write about Mark Twain. Also, \n or other interns who are paid, hosted or otherwise sponsored by a scientific or cultural institution can upload content and write articles in partnership with curators, indirectly providing positive branding for their hosts.\n\nIt's always a good idea to \n your article before adding it to the main article space, and it's required for very new contributors. The \n will guide you through the steps of creating a draft.\n\nPrior to drafting your article, it's a good idea to look at several existing Wikipedia articles on subjects similar to yours to see how such articles are formatted. The quality of our existing articles varies, so try to pick good ones. Many Wikipedia articles have been assessed for quality, which can be checked on the article's talk page. If an article has been assessed as \n-class, or as a \n or \n, it is safe to use as an organizational template for your article. You can also consult Wikipedia's \n to see how articles are supposed to be structured.\n\nGather your sources, summarizing what they say in your own words, adding citations as you go. Clearly establish your subject's notability. Disclose any applicable conflict of interest. Adhere to a neutral point of view and write in an encyclopedic tone.\n\nWhen you feel that the article is ready, you can submit it for review by an experienced editor. If there isn't already a \"Submit for review\" button on the draft, you can add \n to the top of the draft to submit it. A reviewer will then look at your draft and move it to the main article space or give you feedback on how to improve it. You can always edit the page, even while waiting for a review. This may take a long time. There may be additional delay if your sources are not written in English. \n, but many of us cannot read them to verify the statements in your article. Please have patience. We are all volunteers.\n\n users can publish their drafts to mainspace as Wikipedia articles via a \n, as explained in \n.\n\nNow that you have created the page, there are still several things you can do:\n\n. Generally, an article is nowhere near being completed the moment it is created. There is a long way to go. In fact, it may take you several edits just to get it started.\n\nIf you have so much interest in the article you just created, you may learn more about it in the future, and accordingly, have more to add. This may be later today, tomorrow, or several months from now. Any time – go ahead.\n\nTo format your article correctly (and expand it, and possibly even make it \n!), see\n\nOthers can freely contribute to the article when it has been saved. The creator does not have special rights to control the later content. See \n.\n\nAlso, to avoid getting frustrated or offended about the way others modify or remove your contributions, see \n.\n\nAn \n is an article that has few or no other articles linking to it. The main problem with an orphan is that it'll be unknown to others, and it may get fewer readers if it is not de-orphaned. Make sure there are incoming links to the new article from other Wikipedia articles (click \"What links here\" in the toolbox) and that the new article is included in at least one appropriate category (see \n). Otherwise, it will be difficult for readers to find the article.\n\nMost new articles are orphans from the moment they are created, but you can work to change that. This will involve editing one or more \n articles. Try searching Wikipedia for other pages referring to the subject of your article, then turn those references into links by adding double brackets to either side: \"[[\" and \"]]\". If another article has a word or phrase that has the same meaning as your new article that is not expressed using the exact same words as the title, you can link that word or phrase as follows: \n. In certain cases, you could create that word or phrase as a redirect to your new article.\n\nOne of the first things you want to do after creating a new article is to provide links to it so it will not be an orphan. You can do that right away, or, if you find that exhausting, you can wait a while, provided that you keep the task in mind.\n\nSee \n to learn how to get others to see your new articles.\n\nIf the term is ambiguous (meaning there are multiple pages using that or a similar title), see if there is a \n for articles bearing that title. If so, add a link to your article to that page.\n\nRead \n or \n articles on Wikipedia to get the \n, style, \n, and other elements of encyclopedic content. Traditional paper encyclopedias like the \n are also good influences. \n is a good example of an online general purpose encyclopedia. \n is a specialist online encyclopedia, but also a good example. It is suggested that if you plan to write articles for an encyclopedia, you have some background knowledge in formal writing as well as about the topic at hand. A composition class in your high school or college is recommended before you start writing encyclopedia articles. \n\nWhen an experienced editor starts an article directly in mainspace, they routinely take care of things such as:\n\nWhen an editor does not feel certain about being able to fulfill the above requirements with regard to an article they want to create, AfC is probably recommended. This includes very experienced editors, who may be sure about all of the above most of the time, but with regard to a specific subject, they are unsure about a few things.\n"},

As it's your first nomination, I'm happy to give you time to improve this. But, at minimum, you need to settle on an interesting hook with a reliable source that you can clearly cite for it.

Image is appropriately licensed as far as I can determine. QPQ is done. The hook is interesting and supported by an inline citation but not supported in its current format by what is written in the article. The article is a bit ambiguous on this point. On the one hand it asserts that \"[...] it also simulated an amphibious landing in Poland, as well as - and most controversially - a nuclear attack against Poland (hitting Warsaw).\" In my reading, this is a claim that the exercise did in fact contain such a simulation. Later, however, it is stated that \"Other sources noted that the exercise involved nuclear-capable ballistic missiles (Iskander), but not necessarily a simulation of a nuclear attack on another country.\" I think this could be easily solved by re-phrasing the first sentence, but it should be resolved before I give the green light. Otherwise all criteria are fulfilled. \n (\n) 19:34, 6 May 2024 (UTC)\n\n\nNumber of QPQs required: \n.

I would say that the only thing that the article needs is a copyedit, and that the hook should explain where the building is: i propose the following version:\n\n“Mütareke döneminde Habib Bey, İtilaf Devletlerinin talebi doğrultusunda tutuklanarak Bekirağa Bölüğü 'ne hapsedilir.”, “Habib Bey daha sonra 1 yıldan daha fazla kalacağı Malta'ya sürgüne gönderilir.” \n (ref #2)\n\n“Bolulu Habib Bey de 20’likler listesinde Malta’ya sürülür. Malta’da kurulan mahkemede yargılanan Habib Bey, 20 Temmuz 1920’de hiçbir ceza almadan İstanbul’a geri gönderilir. Ancak bir süre sonra tekrar tutuklanır. Bu dönemde Habib Bey’in ailesi bankalara epeyce borçlanmıştı. Osmanlı Bankası’ndan alınan kredilerin faizi bile ödenemez duruma gelir. Bulgur Palas’ın inşaatı da bir türlü bitirilemez. “ \n (ref #3)\n\n 05:11, 6 May 2024 (UTC)\n\n\n\"Bulgur Palace, which Habib Bey allegedly had built by selling bulgur on the black market during the war years, is opening to the public almost 100 years later.

{"title": "Horse racing - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n is an \n performance sport, typically involving two or more \n ridden by \n (or sometimes driven without riders) over a set distance for competition. It is one of the most ancient of all sports, as its basic premise – to identify which of two or more horses is the fastest over a set course or distance – has been mostly unchanged since at least \n.\n\n\nHorse races vary widely in format, and many countries have developed their own particular traditions around the sport. Variations include restricting races to particular \n, running over obstacles, running over different distances, running on different \n, and running in different \n. In some races, horses are assigned different weights to carry to reflect differences in ability, a process known as handicapping.\n\n\nWhile horses are sometimes raced purely for sport, a major part of horse racing's interest and economic importance is in the \n associated with it,\n an activity that in 2019 generated a worldwide market worth around US$115 billion.\n\n\n was founded in 1961 and 1983 but now (2024) have not an official World Horse Racing Championship.\n\n\nHorse racing has a long and distinguished history and has been practiced in civilizations across the world since ancient times. Archaeological records indicate that horse racing occurred in \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n It also plays an important part of myth and legend, such as in the contest between the steeds of the god \n and the giant \n in \n.\n\n was one of the most popular sports of \n, \n and the \n Empire. By 648 BCE, both chariot and mounted horse racing events were part of the ancient \n,\n and were important in the other \n. Chariot racing was dangerous to both driver and horse, often leading to serious injury and even death. In the \n, chariot and mounted horse racing were major industries.\n From the mid-fifth century BCE, \n in Rome closed with a horse race. Fifteen to twenty riderless horses, originally imported from the \n of North Africa, were set loose to run the length of the \n, a long, straight city street. The race lasted about two-and-a-half minutes.\n\nIn later times, \n racing became popular with British royalty and aristocrats, earning it the title of \"Sport of Kings\".\n\n\nHistorically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and displayed the horsemanship required for battle. Horse racing evolved from impromptu competitions among riders and drivers. The various forms of competition, which required demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment. The popularity of equestrian sports throughout the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have vanished once horses were no longer used in combat.\n\n\nIn Britain, horse racing became well-established in the 18th century, and continued to grow in popularity. \n (reigned 1649 to 1685) was an avid sportsman who gave \n its prominence. By 1750, the \n was formed as a way to control the Newmarket races, set the rules of the game, prevent dishonesty, and create a level field.\n The \n began in 1780. \n began with the \n in 1776.  In 1814, the system was complete with five annual races.\n  While Newmarket and the Jockey Club set the standards, most of the racing took place in landowners' fields and in rising towns for small cash prizes and enormous local prestige. The system of wagering was essential to  funding and growing of the industry, and all classes, from paupers to royalty participated. Members of high society were in control, and they made a special effort to keep out the riff-raff and to keep the criminal element away from the wagering. With real money at stake, the system needed skilled jockeys, trainers, grooms, and experts at breeding, which opened up new careers for working-class rural men. Every young ambitious stable boy could dream of making it big.\n\n\nIn addition to its rich history, horse racing is marked by noteworthy statistics. The Thoroughbred Secretariat still holds the fastest times in the 1973 Triple Crown races. Jockey Russell Baze demonstrated exceptional skill with an unmatched 12,842 victories. Economic significance is reflected in the career earnings of the American Pharoah, totaling over $8.6 million. These quantifiable achievements add another facet to the captivating history of horse racing.\"\n\nHorse racing was one of the few sports that continued during the 2020 COVID-19 crisis,\n with the Australian and Hong Kong racing jurisdictions carrying on, albeit with no crowds. The United States, the United Kingdom, and France were some of the more prominent racing bodies to either postpone or cancel all events.\n\nThere are many types of horse racing, including:\n\nDifferent \n have been bred to excel in each of these disciplines. Breeds that are used for flat racing include the \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n Jump racing breeds include the \n and \n. In harness racing, \n are used in Australia, New Zealand and North America. In Europe, \n and \n are used with Standardbreds. Light cold blood horses, such as \n and \n are also used in harness racing within their respective geographical areas.\n\nThere are also races for ponies: both flat and jump\n and harness racing.\n\n\nFlat racing is the most common form of horse racing seen worldwide. Flat racing tracks are typically oval in shape and are generally level, although in Great Britain and Ireland there is much greater variation, including figure-of-eight tracks like \n and tracks with often severe gradients and changes of camber, such as \n. Track surfaces vary, with turf most common in Europe and dirt more common in North America and Asia. Newly designed synthetic surfaces, such as \n or \n, are seen at some tracks.\n\nIndividual flat races are run over distances ranging from 440 yards (400 m) to more than four miles (6.4 km), although races longer than two miles (3.2 km) are quite rare, and distances between five and twelve furlongs (1.0 and 2.4 km) are the most common. Short races are generally referred to as \"sprints\", while longer races are known as \"routes\" in the United States or \"staying races\" in Europe. Although fast acceleration (\"a turn of foot\") is usually required to win either type of race, in general sprints are seen as a test of speed, while long-distance races are seen as a test of stamina. The most prestigious flat races in the world, such as the \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n, are run over distances in the middle of this range and are seen as tests of both speed and stamina to some extent.\n\nIn the most prestigious races, horses are generally allocated the same weight to carry for fairness, with allowances given to younger horses and female horses running against males. These races are called \n and offer the biggest \n. There is another category of races called \n where each horse is assigned a different weight to carry based on its ability.\n Besides the weight they carry, horses' performance can also be influenced by position relative to the inside barrier, sex, jockey, and training.\n\nJump (or jumps) racing in Great Britain and Ireland is known as \n (although, confusingly, National Hunt racing also includes flat races taking place at jumps meetings; these are known as \n races). Jump racing can be subdivided into \n and \n, according to the type and size of obstacles being jumped. The word \"steeplechasing\" can also refer collectively to any type of jump race in certain racing jurisdictions, particularly in the United States.\n\nTypically, horses progress to bigger obstacles and longer distances as they get older, so that a European jumps horse will tend to start in National Hunt flat races as a juvenile, move on to hurdling after a year or so, and then, if thought capable, move on to steeplechasing.\n\nA type of racing where horses go around a track while pulling a sulky and a driver behind them. In this sport, Standardbreds are used. These horses are separated into two categories, trotters and pacers. Pacers move the legs on each side of their body in tandem, while trotters move their diagonal legs together. The latter are typically faster than the former due to the gaits used.\n Occasionally a horse will break their gait into an actual canter or gallop. This could cause the loss of a race or even a disqualification.\n Notable races include the Hambletonian and the Breeder's Crown series.\n\n\nRidden trot races are more common in places such as Europe and New Zealand. These horses are trotters who race on the flat under saddle with a jockey on their backs.\n\n\nThe length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are very short, only ten miles, while other races can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days.\n These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10–20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21–27 miles), competitive trail rides (20–45 miles), progressive trail rides (25–60 miles), and endurance rides (40–100 miles in one day, up to 250 miles (400 km) in multiple days).\n Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used.\n\nContemporary organized \n began in California around 1955, and the first race marked the beginning of the \n This race was a one-hundred-mile, one-day-long ride starting in \n, \n, and ending in \n. Founded in 1972, the American Endurance Ride Conference was the United States' first national endurance riding association.\n The longest endurance race in the world is the \n, which is 1,000 km (620 mi) long.\n\n\nIn most horse races, entry is restricted to certain breeds; that is, the horse must have a sire (father) and a dam (mother) who are studbook-approved individuals of whatever breed is racing.\n For example, in a normal harness race, the horse's sire and dam must both be pure Standardbreds. The exception to this is in Quarter Horse racing, where an Appendix Quarter Horse may be considered eligible to race against (standard) Quarter Horses. The designation of \"Appendix\" refers to the addendum section, or Appendix, of the Official Quarter Horse registry. An Appendix Quarter Horse is a horse that has either one Quarter Horse parent and one parent of any other eligible breed (such as Thoroughbred, the most common Appendix cross), two parents that are registered Appendix Quarter Horses, or one parent that is a Quarter Horse and one parent that is an Appendix Quarter Horse. AQHA also issues a \"Racing Register of Merit\", which allows a horse to race on Quarter Horse tracks, but not be considered a Quarter Horse for breeding purposes (unless other requirements are met).\n\n\nA stallion who has won many races may be put up to \n when he is retired. \n and \n technology (allowed only in some breeds) have brought changes to the traditions and ease of breeding.\n\nPedigrees of stallions are recorded in various books and websites, such as \n, the \n and \n.\n\n\nThere are three founding sires that all Thoroughbreds can trace back to in the male line: the \n, the \n, and the \n, named after their respective owners \n, Lord Godolphin, and Captain Robert Byerly. They were taken to England, where they were bred with mares from English and imported bloodlines.\n The resultant foals were the first generation of thoroughbreds, and all modern thoroughbreds are their descents. Thoroughbreds range in height, which is measured in \n (a hand being four inches). Some are as small as 15 hands while others are over 17. Thoroughbreds can travel medium distances at fast paces, requiring a balance between speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds may be \n, \n, dark bay/brown, \n, \n, \n, \n or \n. Artificial insemination, cloning and embryo transfer are not allowed in the Thoroughbred breed.\n\n\nThe standardbred is a breed of horse used for a variety of purposes, but they are largely bred for harness racing. They are descended from thoroughbreds, morgans, and extinct breeds. Standardbreds are typically docile and easy to handle. They do not spook easily and are quite versatile in what they can do. They can be jumpers, dressage, and pleasure riding horses.\n\n\nThe Arabian horse was developed by the \n people of the West Asia specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the first Arabians was brought to North America,\n  and not until about the time of the \n that they were bred as purebreds. Until the formation of the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1908, Arabians were recorded with the \n in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds.\n\nArabians must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. They have an abundance of type I \n, enabling their muscles to work for extended periods of time. Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds. The Arabian is primarily used today in \n but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries.\n\nArabian Horse Racing is governed by the International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing.\n\n\nThe ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These horses were a blend of \n crossed with English horses that were brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact, muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the \n in 1940.\n\n\nIn order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it less suitable for endurance racing.\n It also has more type II-b muscle fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly.\n\nWhen Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one-quarter of a mile, would be laid instead.\n It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer, 870-yard (800 m) distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt.\n\nIn addition to the three main racing breeds above and their crosses, horse racing may be conducted using various other breeds: Appaloosa, American Paint Horse, \n, AQPS\n and Korean \n.\n\n\nMuscles are bundles of contractile fibers that are attached to bones by tendons. These bundles have different types of fibers within them, and horses have adapted over the years to produce different amounts of these fibers.\n\n\nType I muscle fibers are adapted for \n exercise and rely on the presence of oxygen. They are slow-twitch fibers. They allow muscles to work for longer periods of time resulting in greater endurance.\n\nType II muscles are adapted for \n because they can function in the absence of oxygen.\n\nType II-a fibers are intermediate, representing a balance between the fast-twitch fibers and the slow-twitch fibers. They allow the muscles to generate both speed and endurance. Thoroughbreds possess more Type II-a muscle fibers than Quarter Horses or Arabians. This type of fiber allows them to propel themselves forward at great speeds and maintain it for an extended distance.\n\nType II-b fibers are fast-twitch fibers. These fibers allow muscles to contract quickly, resulting in a great deal of power and speed.\n\nThe conditioning program for the horses varies depending on the race length. Genetics, training, age, and skeletal soundness are all factors that contribute to a horse's performance.\n The muscle structure and fiber type of horses depends on the breed; therefore, genetics must be considered when constructing a conditioning plan. A horse's fitness plan must be coordinated properly in order to prevent injury or lameness. If these are to occur, they may negatively affect a horse's willingness to learn.\n Sprinting exercises are appropriate for training two-year-old racehorses, but the number is limited by psychological factors as well as physical.\n A horse's skeletal system adapts to the exercise it receives. Because the skeletal system does not reach full maturity until the horse is at least six years of age, young racehorses often suffer injuries.\n\n\nIn the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on surfaces of either dirt, synthetic or turf. Other tracks offer \n racing and \n racing, on combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing of other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from 5 to 12 furlongs (0.63 to 1.50 mi; 1.0 to 2.4 km); with this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see \n).\n\nHorse racing in the United States and on the North American continent dates back to 1665, which saw the establishment of the Newmarket course in Salisbury, New York, a section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of \n, New York.\n This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York's colonial governor, \n. The area is now occupied by the present \n, a region of Greater \n and East Garden City. The South Westbury section is still known as Salisbury.\n\nThe first record of quarter-mile length races dated back to 1674 in \n, \n. Each race consisted of only two horses, and they raced down the village streets and lanes. The Quarter Horse received its name from the length of the race.\n\nTracing back the history of horse racing in the United States to its earliest inception in 1665, this sport has become an industry contributing approximately $15 billion to the U.S. economy today.\n Horse racing has become the second most popular \n in the United States with the establishment of historic tracks like Belmont Park, major events like the Kentucky Derby, and significant institutions such as the American Stud Book.\n\nThe \n was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.\n\n\nThe \n at the \n is the oldest remaining horse racing track in America,\n dating from 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agustín Bernal.\n\n is located at the western edge of the Hempstead Plains. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred racecourse in the world, and it has the sport's largest \n.\n\nOne of the latest major horse tracks opened in the United States was the \n, opened in 1977 for Thoroughbred and Harness racing. It is the home of the \n. Other more recently opened tracks include \n, \n, opened in 1988, \n in the \n metro area, opened in 1994, and \n in the \n, opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious \n series of races in 2004.\n\n in the United States has its own \n in \n. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers.\n\nThe traditional high point of US horse racing is the \n, held on the first Saturday of May at \n in \n. Together, the Derby; the \n, held two weeks later at \n in \n, Maryland; and the \n, held three weeks after the Preakness at \n on Long Island, form the \n for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June. In recent years the \n races, run at the end of the year, have challenged the Triple Crown events as determiners of the three-year-old champion. The Breeders' Cup is normally held at a different track every year; however, the 2010 and 2011 editions were both held at Churchill Downs, and 2012, 2013 and 2014 races were held at \n. \n, in Lexington, Kentucky, hosted the 2015 Breeders' Cup.\n\nThe corresponding Standardbred event is the \n. There is also a \n and a \n.\n\nAmerican betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state where the race is located.\n Simulcast betting exists across state lines with minimal oversight except the companies involved through legalized \n. A takeout, or \"take\", is removed from each \n and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed.\n One form of parimutuel gaming is \n, in which players bet on video replays of races.\n\n is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues.\n\nThe most famous horse from Canada is generally considered to be \n, who after winning the \n, Preakness and Queen's Plate in 1964 went on to become the most successful Thoroughbred sire of the twentieth century; his two-minute-flat Derby was the fastest on record until \n in 1973. The only challenger to his title of greatest Canadian horse would be his son \n, who is the last horse to win the English \n. \n (1956) in Toronto is home of the \n (1860), Canada's premier Thoroughbred stakes race, and the \n (1984), Canada's premier Standardbred stakes race. It is the only race track in North America which stages Thoroughbred and Standardbred (harness) meetings on the same day. The \n and \n (1981) are Canada's most important Grade I races worth \n1,000,000 each, and have been won by many renowned horses such as \n and \n respectively. Other key races include \n (1956), \n (1929), \n (1889) and \n (1930).\n\nHorse racing in Belgium takes place at three venues – \n in \n (opened in 1883 in honour of \n), \n in \n in Flanders and \n in \n, \n.\n\nThere are \n in the Czech Republic, most notably Pardubice Racecourse, where the country's most famous race, the \n, has been run since 1874.\n However, the first official race was organized back in 1816 by \n near \n. The Czech horse racing season usually starts at the beginning of April and ends sometime in November. Racing takes place mostly at weekends and there is usually one meeting on a Saturday and one on Sunday.\n Horse races, as well as Thoroughbred horse breeding, is organized by Jockey Club Czech Republic, founded in 1919.\n\n\nFrance has a major horse racing industry. It is home to the famous \n held at \n, the richest race in Europe and the third richest turf race in the world after the \n and \n with a prize of 4  million Euros (approximately US$4.2  million). Other major races include the \n, the \n (the French \n) and the \n. Besides Longchamp, France's other premier flat racecourses include \n and \n. There is also a smaller but nevertheless important jumps racing sector, with Auteil Racecourse being the best known. The sport's governing body is \n.\n\nHorse racing in Great Britain is predominantly thoroughbred \n and \n racing. It was in Great Britain in the 17th to 19th centuries that many of the sport's rules and regulations were established. Named after \n, \n was first run in 1780. The race serves as the middle leg of the British \n, preceded by the \n and followed by the \n. The name \"\n\" has since become synonymous with great races all over the world, and as such has been borrowed many times in races abroad.\n\n\nThe \n is the most prominent race in \n, watched by many people who do not normally watch or bet on horse racing at other times of the year.\n Many of the sport's greatest jockeys, most notably Sir \n, have been British. The sport is regulated by the \n. The BHA's authority does not extend to Northern Ireland; racing in Ireland is governed on an \n basis.\n\nDespite having an ancient tradition with well-documented history, all racetracks in Greece have ceased operation due to the \n.\n\n\nHungary has a long-standing horse racing tradition. The first horse racing in Pest was noted on June 6, 1827.\n Although racing in Hungary is neither as popular nor as prestigious as it is in Western Europe, the country is notable for producing some fine international racehorses. Foremost of these is \n, foaled in 1874 and the most successful Thoroughbred racehorse ever, having won 54 races in 54 starts. The country also produced \n, a horse who won his first 12 races, including \n in Germany and Italy, and finished fourth in the \n at \n.\n\nIreland has a rich history of horse racing; \n originated there, and even today, \n is more popular than racing on the flat. As a result, every year Irish horse racing fans travel in huge numbers to the highlight event of the National Hunt calendar, the \n, and in recent years Irish owned or bred horses have dominated the event.\n Ireland has a thriving Thoroughbred breeding industry, stimulated by favorable tax treatment.\n The world's largest Thoroughbred stud farm, \n, has its main site there (in addition to major operations in the U.S. and Australia).\n\nIn recent years,\n various Irish bred and trained horses achieved victory in one or more of the \n, \n and the \n, considered the three most prestigious races in Europe. In the six runnings of the Epsom Derby between 2008 and 2013, Irish horses filled 20 of the first 30 placings, winning the race 5 times.\n\n\nHistorically, Italy has been one of the leading European horse-racing nations, albeit in some respects behind Great Britain, Ireland, and France in size and prestige. The late Italian horse breeder \n was particularly notable. In recent years, however, the sport in the country has suffered a major funding crisis, culminating in its 2014 expulsion from the European \n.\n\n\nIn \n in \n there is a grass course at \n.\n\nHorse racing in Poland can be dated to 1777, when a horse owned by Polish noble \n beat the horse of the English \n, \n, on the road from \n to \n. The first regular horse racing was organized in 1841 on \n in \n by Towarzystwo Wyścigów Konnych i Wystawy Zwierząt Gospodarskich w Królestwie Polskim (in English, the Society of Horse Racing in Congress Poland). The main racetrack in Poland is Warsaw's Służewiec Racecourse. The industry was severely limited during the \n era, when gambling, the major source of funding, was made illegal.\n\n (also known as trotting), is a popular sport in Sweden, with significant amounts of money wagered annually.\n\nHorse racing in Australia was founded during the early years of settlement and the industry has grown to be among the top three leading Thoroughbred racing nations of the world.\n The world-famous \n, the \n, has recently attracted many international entries. In country racing, records indicate that Goulburn commenced racing in 1834.\n Australia's first country racing club was established at Wallabadah in 1852 and the Wallabadah Cup is still held on New Year's Day (the current racecourse was built in 1898).\n\n\nIn Australia, the most famous racehorse was \n (bred in New Zealand), who raced from 1928 to 1932. Phar Lap carried \n to win the 1930 Melbourne Cup. Australian \n \n is remembered for his battle with Irish champion \n in the 1973 \n. In 2003–2005 the mare \n (bred in Great Britain) became the only racehorse to ever win the \n three times, let alone in consecutive years. Still more recently, another mare, \n. won the prestigious \n four straight times, and set a modern-era world record for most consecutive race wins by a Thoroughbred, winning the last 33 races of her career. In \n, Cane Smoke had 120 wins, including 34 in a single season, \n became a household name during the 1970s, while \n, a pacing horse from New Zealand, enjoyed great success at the highest levels of American harness racing in the 1960s. More recently, \n has won four \n Championships, making him the only horse to complete this feat in Australasia's premier harness race.\n\n\nCompetitive endurance riding commenced in Australia in 1966, when the Tom Quilty Gold Cup was first held in the Hawkesbury district, near Sydney. The Quilty Cup is considered the National endurance ride and there are now over 100 endurance events contested across Australia, ranging in distances from 80 km to 400  km.\n The world's longest endurance ride is the \n 400 km Memorial Test which is conducted over five days traveling 80 kilometers a day at St Albans on the \n, \n. In all endurance events, there are rigorous vet checks, conducted before, during and after the competition, in which the horses' welfare is of the utmost concern.\n\n\nRacing is a long-established sport in New Zealand, stretching back to colonial times.\n\nHorse racing is a significant part of the New Zealand economy which in 2004 generated 1.3% of the GDP. The indirect impact of expenditures on racing was estimated to have generated more than $1.4 billion in economic activity in 2004 and created 18,300 full-time equivalent jobs. More than 40,000 people were involved in some capacity in the New Zealand racing industry in 2004. In 2004, more than one million people attended race meetings in New Zealand.\n There are 69 Thoroughbred and 51 harness clubs licensed in New Zealand. Racecourses are situated in 59 locations throughout New Zealand.\n\nThe bloodstock industry is important to New Zealand, with the export sale of horses – mainly to Australia and Asia – generating more than $120 million a year. During the 2008–09 racing season 19 New Zealand bred horses won 22 Group One races around the world.\n\n\nNotable thoroughbred racehorses from New Zealand include \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\n \n and \n were both bred in New Zealand but did not race there.\n\nThe most famous New Zealand standardbred horse is probably Cardigan Bay. \n drove the New Zealand bred horse, Cardigan Bay to win $1 million in stakes in 1968, the first harness horse to surpass that milestone in \n.\n Other horses of note include \n, \n, Lazarus and the trotter \n.\n\nOn 25 June 1812, the \n was inaugurated by The \n which was founded earlier in the same year by Colonel \n. The Champ de Mars is situated on a prestigious avenue in \n, the capital city and is the oldest racecourse in the \n. The Mauritius Turf Club is the second oldest active turf club in the world.\n\nUndeniably, racing is one of the most popular sports in \n now attracting regular crowds of 20,000 people or more to the only racecourse of the island.\n\nA high level of professionalism has been attained in the organization of races over the last decades preserving the unique electrifying ambiance prevailing on race days at the Champ de Mars.\n\nMembers of the \n, such as \n, \n or \n have attended or patronized races at the Champ de Mars numerous times.\n\nChamp de Mars has four classic events a year such as the Duchess of York Cup, the Barbé Cup, the Maiden Cup, and the Duke of York Cup.\n\nMost of the horses are imported from South Africa but some are also acquired from Australia, the United Kingdom and France.\n\n\nHorse racing is a popular sport in South Africa that can be traced back to 1797. The first recorded race club meeting took place five years later in 1802.\n The national horse racing body is known as the \n and was founded in 1882. The premier event, which attracts 50,000 people to Durban, is the \n, which has been run since 1897 at \n. It is the largest and most prestigious event on the continent, with betting running into the hundreds of millions of Rands. Several July winners have gone on to win major international races, such as Colorado King, London News, and Ipi Tombe.\n However, the other notable major races are the Summer Cup, held at \n in \n, and The Sun Met, which is held at \n in \n.\n\nHorse racing in one form or another has been a part of Chinese culture for millennia. Horse racing was a popular pastime for the aristocracy at least by the \n – 4th century B.C. General \n's stratagem for a horse race remains perhaps the best-known story about horse racing in that period. In the 18th and 19th centuries, horse racing and equestrian sports in China was dominated by \n influences.\n\nThoroughbred horse racing came to China with British settlements in the middle 1800s and most notably centered around the treaty ports, including the two major race courses in Shanghai, the \n and the International Recreation Grounds (in Kiang-wan), and the racecourses of \n. The Kiang-wan racecourse was destroyed in the lead-up to the \n and the Shanghai Race Club closed in 1954. The former Shanghai Racecourse is now People's Square and People's Park and the former club building was the \n.\n\nAs Hong Kong and \n are \n, they're allowed to exemption from ban of gambling on mainland China. (See below)\n\nHorse racing was banned in the \n from 1945, and the People's Republic of China maintained the ban after 1949, although allowances were made for ethnic minority peoples for whom horse sports are a cultural tradition. Speed horse racing (速度赛马) was an event in the \n, mainly introduced to cater to minority peoples, such as the \n. The racecourse was initially 5 km, but from 2005 (the 10th National Games) was extended to 12 km. The longer race led to deaths and injuries to participating horses in both 2005 and the 11th National Games in 2009. Also, with the entry into the sport of \n provinces such as \n, which are better funded and used Western, rather than traditional, breeding and training techniques, meant that the original purpose of the event to foster traditional horse racing for groups like the Mongols was at risk of being usurped. At the 2009 National Games, Hubei won both the gold and silver medals, with \n winning bronze. As a result of these factors, the event was abolished for the 12th National Games in 2013.\n\nClub horse racing reappeared on a small scale in the 1990s. In 2008, the China Speed Horse Race Open in \n was organized as the qualification round for the speed horse race event at the National Games the next year, but was also seen by commentators as a step towards legalizing both horse racing and gambling on the races.\n The Wuhan Racecourse was the only racecourse that organized races in China.\n In 2014, the Wuhan Jockey Club organized more than 80 races. Almost all Chinese trainers and jockeys stabled in Wuhan. However, with the demise of the event at the National Games and the government not relenting from the ban on commercial racing, various racecourses built in recent years are all in a state of disuse: The Nanjing Racecourse, which previously hosted National Games equestrian events, is now used as a car park;\n the \n was shut down in 2008. The racecourse in \n has not been active since 2012.\n\nHorse racing eventually returned to mainland China on the year 2014 as the one-day, five-card event for foreign horses, trainers and jockeys.\n Standardized horse racing events have gradually emerged in China.\n\n\nThe British tradition of horse racing left its mark with the creation of one of the most important entertainment and gambling institutions in Hong Kong. Established as the \n in 1884, the non-profit organization conducts nearly 700 races every season at the two race tracks: in \n and \n.\n\nAll horses are imported since there is no breeding operation.\n The sport annually draws millions of dollars of tax revenue. Off-track betting is available from overseas bookmakers.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Hong Kong Jockey Club had race meetings for visitors already. Visitors were divided into public and member. The charges for these two types of visitors are different.\n\nThe charge for admission to the Public Enclosure is $1 per day for all while soldiers and sailors can enjoy half price. On the other hand, members are required to show their badges to obtain admission to the Members' Enclosure. And also the charge for admission to the Members' Enclosure is $2 per day.\n By comparing the lowest wage in 1929, we observe that the lowest wage is around $12 ( $0.4 per day) which has a large distance for the requirement enclosure.\n Therefore, we can observe that the race meetings are mainly opened for upper class mostly while grass-root has a lower chance to touch horse racing activity.\n\nNowadays, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is a cornerstone of modern Hong Kong. It donates all its profits to the Hong Kong government, charities and public institutions. It is the territory's largest taxpayer, contributing 11% of the government's revenues in 2000. In economic terms, the Hong Kong Jockey Club is an old-fashioned government-protected monopoly; all other forms of gambling are illegal in this industry.\n\n\nSweepstakes were introduced in Hong Kong during the 1920s. There are three types of sweepstakes which are the Special Cash Sweeps, the Last Race Sweep and the Ordinary Cash Sweeps. Special Cash Sweeps were at first drawn twice a year, and increased to three times a year later given its popularity. It carried the highest prize money amongst three types of sweepstakes. The Last Race Sweep commanded higher prize money then Ordinary Cash Sweeps, which were drawn for almost every race and therefore carried the lowest prize money.\n\n\nSweepstakes could be purchased either at sweepstakes stations or from sweepstakes vendors throughout Hong Kong. With different numbers print on each sweepstake, one sweepstake is drawn and assigned, for each horse participating in the race, and the sweepstake attached to the winning horse would win the first prize. Likewise, the number of the first runner-up and second runner-up would win the second and third prize, respectively, with the rest winning consolation prizes. With the introduction of new bet types in horse racing and the launch of the Mark Six lottery in the 1970s, the club finally stopped selling sweepstakes in 1977.\n\n\nJockey Club of Macau was established for harness racing. It started to conduct horse races in 1989.\n\n\nIndia's first racecourse was set up in Madras in 1777. Today India has nine racetracks operated by seven racing authorities.\n\n\nJapan has two governing bodies that control its horseracing – the \n (JRA), and \n (NAR). Between them they conduct more than 21,000 horse races a year. The JRA is responsible for 'Chuo Keiba' (meaning 'central horse racing'), taking place on the ten main Japanese tracks. The NAR, meanwhile, is responsible for 'Chihou Keiba' (meaning 'local horse racing'). Racing in Japan is mainly \n, but Japan also has \n and a sled-pulling race known as \n (also called Draft Racing).\n\nJapan's top stakes races are run in the spring, autumn, and winter. These include the country's most prominent race – the Grade 1 \n, a 2,400 m (about 1½ mile) invitational turf race run every November at \n for a purse of ¥476  million (about US$5.6  million), one of the richest turf races in the world. Other noted stakes races include the \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and the \n races run in the spring and fall. Japan's top jump race is the \n, run every April at \n.\n\nIn \n, horse racing was introduced during the British colonial era and remains to the present day as a gambling activity. There are three race courses in Peninsular Malaysia, namely \n, Perak Turf Club, and \n. Within and only within the turf clubs, betting on horse racing is a legal form of gambling. Racing in Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore is conducted and governed under the Rules of the Malayan Racing Association and betting in Malaysia is operated and organized by Pan Malaysian Pools Sdn Bhd. In East Malaysia, races are governed independently by the Royal Sabah Turf Club\n and the Sarawak Turf Club.\n\n\nMongolian horse racing takes place during the \n festival. Mongolia does not have Thoroughbred horse racing. Rather, it has its own Mongolian style of horse racing in which the horses run for at least a distance of 25 kilometers.\n\n\nHorse races are held in Pakistan at four clubs. In Lahore at \n, Rawalpindi at Chakri, in Karachi at \n, and in Gujrat at Gujrat Race Club.\n\n began in 1867. The history of Philippine horseracing has three divisions according to the breeds of horses used. They are the Philippine-pony era (1867–1898), the Arabian-horse era (1898–1930), and the Thoroughbred-era (1935–present).\n\n\nHorse racing was introduced to Singapore by the British during the colonial era and remained one of the legal forms of gambling after independence. It remains a highly popular form of entertainment with the local Singaporean community to this day. Races are typically held on Friday evenings and Sundays at the \n in \n. Horse racing has also left its mark in the naming of roads in Singapore such as Race Course Road in \n, where horse racing was first held in Singapore, and Turf Club Road in \n where Singapore Turf Club used to be situated before moving to its current location in 1999.\n\n\nHorse racing in South Korea dates back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, it wasn't until the 1920s that modern horse racing involving \n developed. The nation's first authorised club, the Chosun Racing Club, was established in 1922 and a year later, the \n was officially adopted for the first time.\n\n\nThe \n disrupted the development of horse racing in the country, but after the \n in 1988, the Olympic Equestrian Park was converted into racing facilities named \n, which helped the sport to develop again.\n\n\nHorses have been an important role in Turks' lives throughout history. After the modern Republic Of Turkey was established in 1923 by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the number of breeding and racing Arabian and thoroughbred racehorses accelerated rapidly, especially after the beginning of the 1930s. The Jockey Club of Turkey, founded in 1950, was the turning point of both the Turkish breeding and racing industries.\n\nThe big race in the \n is the \n, a race with a purse of US$12 million, which was the largest purse in the world until being surpassed by \n, a race in Riyadh with a $20  million purse that held its first edition in 2020. \n Other races include the \n with a purse of US$250,000.\n\nThe Meydan Racecourse in Dubai, reportedly the world's largest race track, opened on March 27, 2010, for the Dubai World Cup race. The race track complex contains two tracks with seating for 60,000, a hotel, restaurants, theater and a museum.\n\nThere is no parimutuel betting in the UAE as gambling is illegal.\n\n\nIn Argentina the sport is known as turf. Some of the most famous racers are \n, Vilmar Sanguinetti, Marina Lezcano, Jorge Valdivieso, Pablo Falero and Jorge Ricardo. The most notable Argentine horse of recent decades is \n, who won Uruguay's Triple Crown in 2005; won four U.S. Grade I races in 2006, including the \n, on his way to being named that country's \n; and ended his racing career in 2007 with two more Grade I/Group One wins, including the Dubai World Cup.\n\nCarlos Gardel's tango \n is about horse racing, a sport of which he was a known fan. Gardel was a good friend of \n, who is the most recognized Uruguayan jockey, who raced numerous years in Argentine.\n\n\nAt many horse races, there is a gambling station, where gamblers can \n. Gambling on horses is prohibited at some tracks; Springdale Race Course, home of the nationally renowned \n Carolina Cup and Colonial Cup Steeplechase in \n, is known as one of the tracks where betting is illegal, due to a 1951 law. Where gambling is allowed, most tracks offer \n where gamblers' money is pooled and shared proportionally among the winners once a deduction is made from the pool. In some countries, such as the UK, Ireland, and Australia, an alternative and more popular facility is provided by \n who effectively \n in odds. This allows the gambler to 'lock in' odds on a horse at a particular time (known as 'taking the price' in the UK). \n gambling on races also provides not only purse money to participants but considerable tax revenue, with over $100 billion wagered annually in 53 countries.\n\n\nAnna Waller, a member of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of North Carolina, co-authored a four-year-long study of jockey injuries and stated to \n that \"For every 1,000 jockeys you have riding [for one year], over 600 will have medically treated injuries.\" She added that almost 20% of these were serious head or neck injuries. The study reported 6,545 injuries during the years 1993–1996.\n More than 100 jockeys were killed in the United States between 1950 and 1987.\n\n\nHorses also face \n in racing. 1.5 horses die out of every 1,000 starts in the United States.\n The U.S. Jockey Club in New York estimates that about 600 horses died at racetracks in 2006. The Jockey Club in Hong Kong reported a far lower figure of 0.58 horses per 1,000 starts. There is speculation that drugs used in horse racing in the United States, which are banned elsewhere, are responsible for the higher death rate in the United States.\n\n\nIn the Canadian province of \n, a study of 1,709 racehorse deaths between 2003 and 2015 found that the majority of deaths were attributable to \"damage during exercise to the horses' \n\", including fractures, dislocations, and tendon ruptures.\n Mortality rates were eight times higher for \n than \n, and highest amongst young horses. The study also found that the incidence of off-track deaths was twice as high for thoroughbreds.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 186 horses were killed as a direct result of racing in 2019. Of these 145 died in National Hunt (jump) racing and 41 in flat racing.\n A report published in 2005 estimated that \"around 375 horses who are entered into races each season die from their injuries, or they are killed because they are considered of no further commercial value, even though they are young enough to continue racing.\" It added, \"Reasons for horses being destroyed include broken legs, back, neck and pelvis; fatal spinal injuries, exhaustion, heart attack, and burst blood vessels in the lungs.\"\n\n"},

{"title": "2024 Solomon Islands general election - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\nGeneral elections were held in \n on 17 April 2024 to determine the composition of the 12th Parliament.\n Initially planned for 2023, parliament voted in 2022 to delay the elections. Prime Minister \n claimed the country could not afford to have an election in the same year the Solomon Islands were hosting the \n. The opposition condemned the delay and accused Sogavare of a power grab.\n\n\nA major campaign issue included the country's \n; however, domestic issues were a primary concern amongst many voters, including the cost of living, the national debt and medicine shortages. Eight parties and ten independents won seats. Prime Minister Sogavare's \n (OUR) won the most seats, securing 15, but fell short of a majority. The opposition Coalition for Accountability, Reform and Empowerment (CARE) bloc, made up of the \n, \n and the \n, won a combined 13 seats. Another opposition party, the \n (UP), secured six seats. \n\nAfter the election, the OUR Party established the Coalition of National Unity and Transformation with the \n and \n parties. On 29 April, Sogavare announced he would not seek another term as prime minister in the 2 May parliamentary vote. The coalition nominated Foreign Minister \n in his place, while CARE, UP and the \n (SIPRA) selected \n. Manele went on to defeat Wale, with the support of most of the independents.\n\n\nThe previous election, held in 2019, took place following amendments to the electoral act in 2018, which introduced additional measures to prevent electoral fraud, including stricter penalties for candidates and voters engaging in bribery and the implementation of a campaign blackout the day before the election to deter vote-buying.\n However, the maximum campaign budget for candidates saw a rapid increase from SI$50,000 to SI$500,000, resulting in cases of lavish campaign spending.\n\nResults showed no party obtained a majority as in previous elections. Of the eight parties that secured seats, the Solomon Islands Democratic and Kadere parties emerged as the largest; both won eight. Independents won the other 21 seats.\n\n\nWith no dominant party, two blocs formed to compete to take the reins of government. Manasseh Sogavare, who had previously served three non-consecutive terms as prime minister, two of which ended in no-confidence votes, refounded his \n (OUR) shortly after the election.\n The OUR Party, along with the Kadere, People First and Democratic Alliance parties, formed the Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement (DCGA) bloc\n with Sogavare as the DCGA's nominee for prime minister. On the other hand, the Solomon Islands United Party, Solomon Islands Democratic Party and the United Democratic Party formed the Grand Coalition; \n was the bloc's prime ministerial nominee.\n Wale challenged Sogavare's eligibility to serve as prime minister in court, claiming he was ineligible as he registered his party after the election, in breach of the electoral act.\n The High Court suspended Parliament's vote for prime minister shortly before it was to occur on 24 April, having issued an injunction.\n However, citing the constitution, Governor-General \n ordered the vote to proceed.\n In response, Wale and the Grand Coalition boycotted the vote while the remaining members elected Sogavare prime minister.\n Wale then became leader of the opposition.\n Sogavare's return as prime minister resulted in riots in Honiara, stemming from public frustration over the lack of citizen involvement with government formation.\n The High Court later dismissed the case against Sogavare's eligibility to run for prime minister.\n\nThe OUR Party saw numerous MPs join after the election, and by November 2019, the party had attained a comfortable majority of 32 seats.\n\n\nIn November 2021, protests broke out in \n near parliament. Sogavare's government withdrew Solomon Islands' recognition of \n in 2019 and established diplomatic ties with China. The switch faced condemnation by the opposition and the provincial government of \n, which maintained de facto relations with Taipei, increasing tensions between Sogavare and Malaita Premier \n. Many protesters were from Malaita province and demanded Sogavare's resignation due to the decision to pursue ties with Beijing, along with other factors, including allegations of the central government ignoring the public on issues including infrastructure. When Sogavare did not address the demonstrators, riots broke out. Police attempted to disperse the crowds by firing tear gas while the government imposed a 36-hour lockdown in the capital.\n Demonstrators defied the curfew and took to \n.\n Numerous businesses and a police station were burnt down,\n resulting in three deaths. Once the rioting ceased, military personnel and police from \n, \n, \n and \n were deployed to help restore order.\n Opposition Leader Matthew Wale called for Sogavare to do \"the honourable thing and resign\" and announced he would file a \n if the prime minister refused. Sogavare resisted calls to step down and blamed interference from unnamed foreign powers for the riots, stating, \"I don't want to name names…we know who they are\".\n Wale subsequently introduced a no-confidence motion, which Parliament voted on in December 2021. During the debate, Sogavare claimed the \"innocent people of Malaita have been lied to by these agents of Taiwan\" and described the riots as an \"attempted illegal coup\". Sogavare survived the no-confidence motion with 32 MPs voting to keep him in office.\n\n\nIn March 2022, the DCGA government signed a security pact with China, which permits Solomon Islands to request the deployment of Chinese military personnel to assist the \n in restoring order in the event of a similar incident to the \n. In such a scenario, Chinese personnel would also protect Chinese-owned businesses, nationals and diplomats.\n The full details of the pact were not made public.\n Reportedly, a part of his \"friends to all, enemy to none\" foreign policy, Prime Minister Sogavare believed that the pact would benefit Solomon Islands by providing the country with more stability, which would attract more investors and result in further development. The opposition condemned the agreement, claiming it would provide more leverage for Chinese influence that would undermine Solomon Islands' democracy. They pledged to repeal it if they were to oust the DCGA government at the election. Two groups, Transparency Solomon Islands and Solomon Islands Council of Women, claimed the pact would not represent the public's interests, that it would effectively cede the country's sovereignty to China and condemned its alleged lack of holistic consultation with Solomon Islanders. Australia, Fiji, Japan, the \n, New Zealand and the United States voiced concerns with the pact. These countries, along with others in the region, also feared how the agreement might allow China to establish a military base in Solomon Islands, which both Honiara and Beijing denied.\n The pact prompted the United States to re-open an embassy in Honiara in 2023.\n\n\nThe governor-general must schedule a general election to take place within four months of the dissolution of parliament. The nomination period commences the day after the announcement of the election date and concludes 42 days before the poll. The period for campaigning begins on the day of the proclamation of the polling date and ceases the day before the election.\n The 50 members of the \n are elected in single-member \n using \n. Candidates are required to be at least 21 years old and resident in the constituency they contest. Disqualifications included holding dual citizenship, being executives or members of the Electoral Commission, having an undischarged bankruptcy, being imprisoned for more than six months, or being under a death sentence.\n The 2018 electoral act raised the non-refundable nomination fee from SI$2000 to SI$5000 in an attempt to lower the number of candidates, especially \"shadow candidates\" who ran with the sole purpose of splitting votes to benefit other contestants. The electoral commission argued that with fewer candidates, the victor would gain a more decisive mandate.\n Candidates running as a member of a registered political party are not permitted to change their affiliation after the confirmation of their nomination; unless they withdraw and file their candidacy again.\n\n\nVoters must be at least 18 years old and hold \n. Individuals disqualified from voting include those that have committed a breach of the electoral law, been declared insane, been imprisoned for more than six months, or were under a death sentence.\n The 2018 electoral act introduced pre-polling, open to polling staff and police officers that are to provide security for voting centres on election day.\n In early February 2024, the chief electoral officer of the election commission, Jasper Highwood Anisi, announced that citizens abroad on election day, including seasonal workers in Australia and New Zealand, would be unable to vote as absentee voting would not occur. Around the time of the 2024 election, there were no provisions for overseas voting. Anisi said seasonal workers would possibly be able to vote from abroad in future elections.\n A total of 420,185 citizens were registered to vote in this election.\n\n\nIn September 2022, the Sogavare government passed a bill in parliament, delaying the dissolution of the \n, which was due to occur on 19 May 2023, by several months to 31 December, to enable the postponement of the 2023 general election to 2024.\n As Solomon Islands were hosting the Pacific Games in 2023, Sogavare said the election delay was necessary, arguing the country could not afford to hold two major events in the same year as it was still recovering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2021 unrest.\n Many citizens were reportedly sceptical about the intentions behind the delay, which also raised fears of unrest.\n A survey conducted by Transparency Solomon Islands from 31 March to 1 April 2022 found that 83% of the 2,178 respondents from the public opposed the deferral.\n The opposition denounced the postponement as anti-democratic and a \"power grab\". Opponents also criticised how the government had rushed the bill through parliament, evading the regular procedures that allow for public input. Opposition Leader Wale said the prime minister had \"succeeded in making [Solomon Islands] the laughing stock of the region, as a country that is prepared to tamper with its own constitution for a two-week event, against the clear wishes of its people\".\n Sogavare claimed the postponement would not threaten the democratic process and said opponents to the bill lacked evidence that it was undemocratic.\n An electoral amendment bill passed by parliament on 14 December 2023 arranged for the national election to occur on the same day as the provincial and Honiara City Council elections,\n marking the first joint elections in Solomon Islands since independence. The only two provinces not to schedule provincial elections for 17 April were \n and \n,\n which held elections in 2022.\n On 26 January 2024, the electoral commission scheduled the election for 17 April.\n\n\nActing Governor-General \n confirmed the election date in a formal announcement on 20 February. The following day, the campaign period and the candidate nomination process commenced, with the latter concluding on 6 March. The deadline for candidates wishing to withdraw was set for 8 March by the electoral commission.\n\n\nA total of 334 candidates were nominated to contest the election,\n a similar amount to the 332 in the 2019 election.\n Only 21 contestants were women, comprising 6% of all candidates, a slight decrease from 26 in 2019. Two incumbent female MPs did not seek re-election.\n Of all the candidates, 219 were affiliated with one of the 13 contesting parties, while the other 115 ran as independents.\n The Solomon Islands Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance Party established an alliance before the election, named the Coalition for Accountability, Reform and Empowerment (CARE).\n Most parties in the Solomon Islands tend to lack a consistent or cohesive ideology,\n instead focusing on one or more of the following: the policies and personality of the party leader, religion, regional or tribal loyalty, and/or familial ties.\n This results in the parties being unstable and membership fluid, with members of parliament \n being common.\n\nSolomon Islands' relations and security pact with China were a significant issue during the campaign. However, many voters were more concerned about domestic matters, including medicine shortages in clinics throughout the country, education, the poor quality of roads, the cost of living and the national debt.\n Transparency Solomon Islands head Ruth Liloqula criticised the contesting parties for running campaigns \"mainly based on foreign policies\" and called on them to give more attention to domestic issues.\n \n\nOn 8 February, the OUR Party launched a manifesto.\n Party leader and Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare announced the OUR Party's five most prioritised policies going into the election. The first was preserving social cohesion and national unity to prevent ethnic tensions from rising, as in 2000. Enhancing the nation's legal and governing systems to guarantee public safety was another key priority, as was socio-economic growth; the party pledged to utilise the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific, the Solomon Islands Infrastructure Program and China's \n. The OUR Party's fourth priority was national defence, security and trade; the party sought to preserve relations with Australia and other traditional allies while expanding ties with China as part of a \"look north\" policy. The fifth key priority was development and land and resources empowerment.\n During a campaign rally in the Malaitan provincial capital of \n, Sogavare delivered a speech where he praised the Chinese political system and declared his government's decision to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China to have \"put Solomon Islands on the map\". Sogavare also claimed that democracy leads to moral decline and same-sex marriage.\n\n\nOn 7 February, the \n (DAP), led by former Prime Minister \n and the \n (SIDP), led by Opposition Leader \n, established the Coalition for Accountability, Reform and Empowerment (CARE) to contest the election.\n Along with the DAP and SIDP, Umi for Change was also a member party of CARE.\n The CARE coalition released a manifesto on 14 February; issues it highlighted include job creation, infrastructure investment, implementing free education, decreasing the cost of living and creating 25,000 jobs over a four-year period.\n CARE pledged to implement a 15% pay rise for public servants and enhance the nation's health services. The coalition also promised to address medicine shortages in health establishments nationwide and to ease the overburdened National Referral Hospital in Honiara by funnelling more resources into provincial hospitals.\n The coalition's leader, Matthew Wale, criticised the Parliamentary Entitlement Commission (PEC), which oversees the entitlements of parliamentarians, for its plans to implement a pay increase for members of parliament. Pointing to issues such as the struggling economy, the healthcare crisis and the poor quality of roads nationwide, Wale described PEC's decision as a \"slap in the face\" to Solomon Islanders and announced CARE's intention to replace the PEC with a High Salaries Commission; intending to monitor the salaries of public servants and provide more accountability and transparency.\n Regarding foreign policy, Wale announced that CARE would maintain a balanced engagement with foreign countries, including China and the United States. Wale stressed the coalition would ultimately prioritise the national interests of Solomon Islands and ensure that consultation with the public would occur before making foreign policy decisions.\n\n\nThe then-premier of Malaita Province, \n, formed the Umi for Change Party (U4C) in 2022.\n Suidani, a vocal critic of the Sogavare government's switch of diplomatic recognition from Taiwan to China and its expansion of ties with the latter, was ousted as premier in 2023 after losing a no-confidence vote, allegedly due to his opposition to the switch.\n Suidani explained that U4C is a successor to the Malaita Alliance for Rural Advancement government, which he led as premier of Malaita.\n The Political Parties Commission approved U4C's registration on 9 January 2024; the party subsequently launched a manifesto. One of U4C's key policies included revoking the absolute legal immunity that public officials enjoy. Suidani said this policy was necessary, citing numerous officials allegedly \"hiding behind the law\" and \"making reckless decisions on behalf of the state.\" The party also pledged to address gender inequality and focus on youth-related issues;\n U4C aimed to establish an education program on employment to decrease youth unemployment.\n\n\nThe \n focused on governance and economic transformation. General Secretary Martin Housanau announced the party would focus on shifting Solomon Islands' economy away from raw material production and into a value-adding economy as part of an industrialisation redirection. The Party also advocated for land law reform; Housanau claimed land issues were the most prominent obstacles to economic development and argued: \"There are three factors of production in the economy, these are, capital, labour and land if any of these three factors is absent, the economy will become stagnant and decline\".\n\n\nThe \n (SIPRA), led by former Prime Minister \n,\n pledged to provide additional resources to assist the anti-corruption commission. Lilo claimed that despite the passage of an anti-corruption act, the government had taken little action in combatting corruption and suggested the anti-corruption commission was under-resourced.\n The party also promised to assist small and medium-sized businesses nationwide and invest in the agricultural, tourism and fisheries sectors. Viewing small and medium businesses as key to economic recovery and growth, Lilo cited the roles these businesses have played in numerous Asian countries.\n Like the UP and CARE, SIPRA called for a review of the security pact with China.\n\n\nThe \n (UP) launched its campaign on 7 March. A core aspect of the UP's manifesto was unity in diversity; the party advocated for developing a \"real national identity\" whilst preserving the ethnically diverse nation's numerous cultural identities.\n Party leader \n, son of the nation's first prime minister, \n,\n announced the UP would re-establish ties with Taiwan while maintaining relations with China and reviewing China's security deal.\n The party also sought to preserve relations with traditional development partners, although Kenilorea warned that Solomon Islands should not hold them as the country's sole saviours.\n The UP called for a diversification of the economy and warned that the country's reliance on limited income streams, especially logging exports, left Solomon Islands vulnerable to external economic crises. Addressing issues regarding critical infrastructure was another priority for the party, particularly the poor state of the roads and bridges.\n\n\nA week before the election, Russia's state-owned \n news agency published an article featuring anonymous claims that the United States and \n were planning an \"electoral coup\" in Solomon Islands, which were repeated by the \n newspaper \n. In response, US Ambassador \n dismissed the allegations as \"blatantly misleading claims about the United States' engagement in the region.\"\n\n\nIn September 2022, the Australian government proposed to assist in funding the general elections. The DCGA government initially criticised the offer and accused the Australian government of foreign interference, alleging they disclosed the offer occurred when parliament debated delaying the general election to influence the opposition. Opposition MP \n denounced the DCGA government's response as \"extremely unhelpful\" and claimed it was evidence of Sogavare attempting to hold onto power. \n \n denied the allegation and pointed to Australia having supported previous elections in the Solomon Islands.\n Once parliament approved the postponement, Sogavare announced that the government would accept Canberra's offer.\n The Solomon Islands government allocated approximately \n$40 million to fund the national, provincial and Honiara City Council elections. The Australian government contributed SI$55 million, while the New Zealand government provided SI$35 million. The overall budget was SI$130 million.\n\n\nOn 25 March 2024, New Zealand announced that it would deploy the \n vessel \n to transport two helicopters and crew, along with command and maintenance personnel, to the Solomon Islands as part of a NZ$10.8 million ($6.48 million) support program for the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission agreed upon in January that would help transport election officers and materials across the archipelago.\n In addition to the New Zealand personnel, police officers and soldiers from Australia, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea were also deployed to assist the \n in providing security. Chinese police would help with training officers.\n\n\nPre-polling was held on 5 April in Honiara for electoral officials and police officers providing security for polling stations on election day.\n On 8 April, Home Affairs Minister \n announced that election day would be a public holiday to ensure a smoother electoral process. Laore also declared that a ban on the sale of liquor would be in place from 16 to 26 April, mandating the closure of liquor shops, nightclubs and bars during this period, except for licensed restaurants and hotels.\n The ban was later extended to 15 May on account of the prime minister's election and the formation of a new government.\n An emergency was declared at the country's main hospital due to shortages of staff who went to vote.\n \n\nOn election day, polling stations were open from 7:00 to 16:00. Voters waiting in line at closing time were still allowed to vote.\n More than 1,000 polling stations were opened nationwide,\n while around 6,780 election officials were involved, which was twice that of 2019 as the parliamentary election also coincided with elections for eight out of ten provincial assemblies and the \n for the first time. Voting was reportedly peaceful and went without violence.\n Counting of ballots began on 18 April and is expected to last several weeks.\n\n\nOn 24 April, the chair of the Solomon Islands Electoral Commission (SIEC), Teasi Sanga, officially declared the election concluded.\n Final results released showed that no party gained a majority in Parliament, prompting negotiations to form a governing coalition. Prime Minister Sogavare's OUR party attained a plurality of 15 of the chamber's 50 seats,\n however, 18 of the party's incumbent MPs lost their seats, including Police Minister Anthony Veke, and no newcomers from the party were elected.\n The CARE coalition secured 13 seats, and the UP won six (with one member elected as an independent aligning with them after the elections, increasing the party's seat count to seven).\n The remaining seats went to smaller parties and independents. Sogavare himself was narrowly re-elected in his seat of \n and claimed the United States had attempted to unseat him.\n Three women were elected; one, \n, was an incumbent, while the other two were newcomers.\n\n\nThirty-nine pre-poll ballot papers from three constituencies in \n were reportedly not counted during the election counting process.\n Chief Electoral Officer Jasper Highwood Anisi said that a review on the election would be completed.\n\n\nIn \n, former Premier \n, who was removed from his position following a no-confidence vote in the Provincial Assembly in 2023, was re-elected, while his successor, \n, lost his seat.\n A few disturbances were recorded in the province and were blamed on supporters of losing candidates.\n Three women were elected to the provincial assemblies in \n, Malaita, and \n, while two women were also elected to the Honiara City Council.\n\n\nNegotiations to form a government reportedly began the day before the election.\n Following the election, the OUR Party and the opposition began efforts to win over the ten kingmaker independents. Sogavare claimed the opposition parties faced divisions in who to field for prime minister.\n CARE coalition Leader Matthew Wale, UP Leader Peter Kenilorea Jr., and former Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo emerged as potential candidates to take on Sogavare for prime minister.\n On 26 April, Sogavare announced that the OUR Party had renewed an alliance with the People First Party, giving the bloc 18 seats, claiming it had enough support to form a government. However, he did not name other coalition partners.\n On 27 April, CARE signed a coalition agreement with the UP, increasing the alliance's seat count to 20.\n \n\nGovernor-General \n announced on 29 April that a parliamentary vote to elect the prime minister would take place on 2 May.\n The OUR Party and People First Party were later joined by the Kadere Party, forming the Coalition of National Unity and Transformation. Shortly before nominations for the prime ministerial election opened, Sogavare announced on 29 April that he would not stand for another term as prime minister and resign as the OUR Party leader, which he said was a \"collective decision\". The bloc instead nominated Foreign Minister \n, who also succeeded Sogavare as leader of the OUR Party.\n The CARE coalition, along with the UP and SIPRA, nominated Matthew Wale for prime minister.\n Before the prime ministerial election, Manele's coalition claimed to have secured the support of the independents, providing the bloc with 28 seats.\n Prime ministerial elections in Solomon Islands are often unpredictable, as MPs are not legally barred from switching parties. Another factor is the vast difference in income and benefits between government MPs and the opposition.\n Ruth Liloqula, the chief executive of Transparency Solomon Islands, claimed many MPs were changing affiliation, motivated by personal and political gain rather than by policies and principles. She highlighted how many of the newly elected independent MPs had campaigned for a change in government, with some unseating OUR Party members, only to join the party's coalition after the election.\n The elections for prime minister are conducted through a secret ballot. Although it is held in the National Parliament, it is not a parliamentary meeting and is presided over by the governor-general rather than the speaker.\n Manele won with 31 votes, defeating Wale, who earned 18. There was one abstention.\n\n\nFollowing his election, Manele called on citizens to refrain from post-election violence, urging to \"respect and uphold the democratic process of electing our prime minister and set an example for our children and their children\".\n\n\nAustralian Prime Minister \n congratulated Manele on his election as prime minister and said he looked forward to working closely with him.\n Papua New Guinean Deputy Prime Minister \n visited Manele on 3 May where he presented a congratulatory letter behalf of Prime Minister \n. Rosso also emphasised Papua New Guinea's commitment to maintaining close ties with Solomon Islands.\n\n"},

The non-voting members include one representative from \n and one representative from \"the interfaith community\".\n On 16 April, the Primature confirmed the appointment of the nine members nominated by the Transitional Presidential Council in Kingston.\n\n\nMembers of the TPC must meet the requirements for holding the office of president as established under Article 135 of the \n and are disqualified from standing for the presidency in the next election.\n Differences introduced in the decree include that individuals are ineligible for appointment to the Council if they have been sanctioned by the United Nations, if they are under criminal indictment or have been found guilty of a crime in any jurisdiction, or if they oppose the introduction of the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti. Similarly, the government added in article 5 that all members must pursue the accelerated deployment of the international security force.\n\n\nUnder the terms of the decree of 12 April, the Transitional Presidential Council will exercise functions of the office of president until such time as a new president is elected and inaugurated.\n Its mandate to act concludes on 7 February 2026.\n The TPC's authority extends to the appointment of a prime minister and government and Henry has agreed to resign from the office of prime minister at such time as the TPC designates someone else to hold the office.\n\n\nThe drafters of the agreement rejected the governmental decree on 13 April and called upon the members of the resigning government to publish the original agreement without modification.\n\nReactions within Haiti to the announcement of the TPC were mixed, with some Haitians questioning its constitutional legitimacy.\n Shortly after the council's announcement, Jacky Lumarque, rector of \n, described the council as not being a \"Haitian-led\" solution, calling it a \"snake of seven heads\".\n He called for a judge of the Court of Cassation to be empowered as unitary acting president, instead.\n\n\nJimmy \"Barbecue\" Chérizier said his forces would attack any person who accepted appointment to the council. Chérizier also invoked a traditional Haitian battle cry to describe the fate that would befall councilors: \"Cut off their heads and burn down their houses\".\n Chérizier earlier objected to the lack of input his federation, the \n, had had in governance transition talks. He also entered into an alliance with another federation of gangs, G-Pèp, to organize plans for armed resistance to any entry of foreign peacekeepers into the country as part of a future transitional arrangement.\n\n\nCamille LeBlanc, former Haitian minister of justice, said he welcomed the creation of the council but doubted the ability of such a body to resolve Haiti's political impasse.\n\n\nIn an official statement, \n \n said he \"welcomed\" the creation of the Transitional Presidential Council and urged \"all Haitian stakeholders to continue making progress in putting in place transitional governance arrangements\".\n The Caribbean Community welcomed the creation of the TPC saying it was a \"Haitian owned formula for governance that will take the troubled country through elections to the restoration of the lapsed state institutions and constitutional government\".\n\n\nThe \n stated the U.S. \"welcomes\" the creation of the TPC and \"commends Haitian leaders for making tough compromises to move toward democratic governance via free and fair elections\".\n \n \n welcomed the creation of the TPC, writing on social media that \"Kenya expresses confidence that the new political leadership will lay a strong foundation for resolution of the crisis in Haiti, restoration of security, afford the Haitian people a political transition and usher in sustainable peace and development\".\n\n\nIn a press release issued 14 April, Louise Mushikiwabo of \n \"commended\" the creation of the Transitional Presidential Council.\n On 15 April, the \n, through the \n, said it was \"crucial that the TPC is formally appointed without further delay by the outgoing government of Prime Minister Ariel Henry\".\n\n"},

Among its provisions, the President is given further powers while the position of Prime Minister is abolished to allow government policies to be passed more easily. Government officials, ministers and presidents can also be tried before courts once they leave their office.\n Henry signed an agreement for a consensual transitional government with opposition political parties on 11 September. Under the agreement, a new \n will be formed which will include members of the \n in its functioning. Meanwhile, the government also agreed to hold a trial for the \n scandal; in addition to conducting investigations into the massacres that occurred in \n, \n and Delmas 32. The agreement contains provisions for the establishment of a two-headed \n of Haiti, while the country will be governed by the \n under the leadership of Henry.\n It allows the elections to be delayed to late 2022.\n Over 169 political and civil organizations had signed the agreement until 12 September according to Henry, however he has sought support of more organizations.\n\n\nAt the \n of the \n on 25 September, Henry spoke about the recent expulsion of Haitian migrants by the United States from its \n and stated that while he did not wish to challenge its right to expel illegal migrants, migration would continue until wealth inequality no longer existed in the world. He urged wealthy countries to help less-developed ones improve their living standards more quickly to prevent it, and criticized the \n agents for their conduct while stopping the Haitian migrants. Henry also stated that his government was trying to apprehend Moïse's killers and asked for \"mutual legal assistance\" before the assembly, while promising to restore democratic governance in Haiti quickly.\n Henry dismissed all members of the Provisional Electoral Council on 27 September.\n The elections were postponed indefinitely and he promised to appoint a new election council.\n The next day, Henry told the \n that he planned to hold the constitutional referendum in February 2022, and hoped to hold the elections in early-2022. He also stated that the Haitian migrants recently expelled from the \n would be assisted by the government in setting up small businesses, and criticized the treatment meted out to them by the United States.\n\n\nHenry named a new ministerial cabinet on 24 November, consisting of eight new appointments\n and appointing himself as the acting \n. A 52-member National Transitional Council was named on 12 December under the \"Montana Accord\", a competing accord against Henry's own \"September 11th Accord\", being given the task of selecting a new President and Prime Minister until elections were held.\n On 1 January 2022, Henry fled \n after a shootout between his security forces and an unknown armed group.\n The attempt on his life occurred outside the cathedral in Gonaïves, where a ceremony marking the 218th anniversary of Haitian independence was taking place.\n  The incident resulted in one death and two others were injured.\n Henry accused \"bandits\" of trying to assassinate him, and stated that the state should never bow to their demands.\n Delegates of various accords, including the Montana Accord, chose \n as the interim President of Haiti on 17 January during a unitary summit.\n Henry however stated on Twitter that the next President would be elected by the Haitian people, apparently rejecting attempts at a transitional government.\n After the Montana Accord signatories chose Jean as the interim President and Steven Benoît as the Prime Minister in late January,\n Henry rejected giving recognition to it on 7 February. He also promised to announce the date of the elections soon, while his opponents demanded that he step down since the legal mandate of late President Jovenel Moïse, who had appointed him, formally expired that day.\n\n\nIn an interview with the \n on 11 February, Henry stated that he was willing to hand over suspects in the case of Moïse's assassination to the United States, as he supported their investigation into the former President's death and believed that the \n was weak. He also stated that he supported appointing a judge from another country to oversee the case independently in Haiti and he would seek the assistance of the \n for it.\n During the 2 June meeting of the Aid Effectiveness Committee of the Coordination Framework of external aid for the development of Haiti, Henry stated that improving the security situation in the country was a prerequisite for holding the elections.\n On 11 September, he stated that the government would begin the organization of elections by the end of 2022.\n\n\nAn announcement by Henry on 11 September regarding a reduction in subsidies on fuel, more than doubling the cost of petrol, diesel and kerosene, led to countrywide protests and gangs preventing fuel from being unloaded at the \n, creating a nationwide shortage.\n On 5 October, Henry appealed to the international community for help in resolving \n.\n Two days later, he and the Council of Ministers authorized the government to request international military assistance.\n The G9 alliance of gangs announced the lifting of their blockade of the Varreux terminal on 11 November.\n Henry fired Justice Minister Berto Dorcé and Interior Minister Liszt Quitel on 14 November, three days after the Government Commissioner Jacques Lafontant was dismissed due to a complaint by Henry. Henry appointed himself as the acting Interior Minister, while \n was appointed as the Justice Minister.\n\n\nOn 21 December 2022, Henry along with representatives of political parties, civil society organizations and the private sector signed an agreement to hold the general elections in 2023, with the new government taking office on 7 February 2024. It also established a three-member High Council for the Transition with powers to take part in appointment of government officials and overseeing the various government departments, along with a Government Action Control Body to ensure the compliance of the government with the rules and transparency.\n Protesting police officers attacked Henry's official residence and \n on 26 January 2023, in response to a rise in killings of fellow officers. Henry, who was at the airport at the time, was able to escape.\n The High Council for the Transition was formally installed by him on 6 February 2023.\n In February 2024 however, he stated that the general elections will be held when the government was able to control the security situation in Haiti.\n The \n later in the month said that he had committed to holding the elections by 31 August 2025.\n\n\nHenry was invited by Haiti's \n Bedford Claude on 10 September 2021 for an interview regarding Moïse's assassination. Claude stated that Henry had been in contact with Joseph-Félix Badio, one of the main suspects on the day of the assassination.\n Henry, however, rejected giving permission on the next day, calling it a \"diversionary tactic\".\n Renan Hédouville, the head of the \n, demanded Henry's resignation on 13 September, and also called on him to cooperate with the investigation into Moïse's assassination.\n Claude on 14 September requested the judge investigating the assassination to charge Henry and told the immigration authority to ban him from leaving the country.\n Henry meanwhile fired him, but a source told the \n that he had no authority to take such an action.\n\n\nRenald Lubérice, the \n of the Council of Ministers, resigned on 15 September due to the allegations against Henry and accused him of trying to obstruct justice. Henry meanwhile fired the \n Rockefeller Vincent, who had ordered increased security for Bedford Claude citing threats to him.\n Henry's office addressed the allegations against him on 16 September, stating that he had received calls from numerous people inquiring about his safety after Moïse's assassination, and it could not identify every caller. It also dismissed suspicions against Henry, stating that contact with a suspect cannot be used to implicate someone in a case.\n Asked about his calls with Badio later by Associated Press, Henry stated that he did not remember them.\n\n\nOn 10 January 2022, an investigative report published by \n stated that Henry had links with Joseph-Félix Badio, an alleged mastermind of  Moïse's assassination, and that the two stayed in close contact even after the assassination. Two Haitian officials told the newspaper that Badio entered Henry's residence twice without being impeded by the guards, despite being wanted. Another of the prime suspects, Rodolphe Jaar, while admitting to having financed and planned the assassination, stated that Badio had described Henry as someone he could count on as an ally and could control after overthrowing Moïse. Jaar claimed that Badio had sought Henry's help in escaping, to which he agreed.\n\n\nOn 8 February, a recording of judge Garry Orélien, who previously oversaw the investigation of the assassination, was obtained by \n in which Orélien accused Henry of being among those who planned the assassination of Moïse. He also accused Henry of being \"connected and friends with\" the mastermind of the assassination. This claim was also backed by multiple Haitian law enforcement officials who had investigated the assassination as well, and who also told CNN that Henry was obstructing the investigation.\n Orélien denied having this conversation,\n later in an interview with \n he denied accusing Henry, while claiming that the CNN report intended to murder his career and force him to go into exile or be killed.\n On 11 February, Henry dismissed the allegations of his involvement as \"fake news\" and called on Badio to hand himself over to the authorities. He also added that no Haitian or American official had questioned him regarding the case.\n\n\nHenry traveled to \n on 25 February 2024, and days later to \n to sign an agreement on the deployment of 1,000 Kenyan policemen in Haiti.\n When he tried to return to Haiti, he was unable to land as gang attacks shuttered the Toussaint Louverture International Airport and freed more than 4,000 prison inmates. Henry remained outside the country, signing his resignation in April 2024 from Los Angeles.\n The Economy and Finance Minister \n assumed the role of acting Prime Minister on 25 February in his absence.\n\n\nOn 11 March, Henry agreed to resign as the country's leader once a \n was formed, following a meeting in \n with leaders of Caribbean states and U.S. Secretary of State \n.\n By 13 March, some political parties said they would not participate in the deal.\n The council was formalized on 12 April,\n with members being named on 16 April\n and sworn in on 25 April when Henry presented his resignation in a letter signed on 24 April in Los Angeles. Henry's outgoing cabinet meanwhile appointed Boisvert as the interim Prime Minister.\n\n\nAriel Henry is the son of Elie S. Henry, who was a pastor and an \n of the \n.\n Ariel's father died on 20 December 2015. He is married to Annie Claude Massiau and his siblings are named Monique Henry, Edlyne Henry Richard, Elie Henry and Elvire Henry.\n His brother Elie is also a pastor and is the president of the \n since 2018, after he was elected for that role in that year and re-elected in 2022.\n\n"},

Currently, NASA supports the \n along with the \n, and oversees the development of the \n and the \n for the lunar \n.\n\nNASA's science division is focused on better understanding Earth through the \n;\n advancing \n through the efforts of the \n's Heliophysics Research Program;\n exploring bodies throughout the \n with advanced \n such as \n and \n such as \n;\n and researching \n topics, such as the \n, through the \n, the \n and associated programs.\n The \n oversees launch operations for its \n.\n\nNASA traces its roots to the \n (NACA). Despite being the birthplace of aviation, by 1914 the United States recognized that it was far behind Europe in aviation capability. Determined to regain American leadership in aviation, Congress created the \n of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1914 and established NACA in 1915 to foster aeronautical research and development. Over the next forty years, NACA would conduct aeronautical research in support of the \n, \n, \n, and the civil aviation sector. After the end of \n, NACA became interested in the possibilities of guided missiles and supersonic aircraft, developing and testing the \n in a joint program with the \n. NACA's interest in space grew out of its rocketry program at the Pilotless Aircraft Research Division.\n\n\nThe Soviet Union's launch of \n ushered in the \n and kicked off the \n. Despite NACA's early rocketry program, the responsibility for launching the first American satellite fell to the \n's \n, whose operational issues ensured the \n would launch \n, America's first satellite, on February 1, 1958.\n\nThe \n decided to split the United States' military and civil spaceflight programs, which were organized together under the \n's \n. NASA was established on July 29, 1958, with the signing of the \n and it began operations on October 1, 1958.\n\n\nAs the United States' premier aeronautics agency, NACA formed the core of NASA's new structure, absorbing its 8,000 employees and three major research laboratories. NASA also proceeded to absorb the Naval Research Laboratory's \n, the Army's \n, and the \n under \n. This left NASA firmly as the United States' civil space lead and the Air Force as the military space lead.\n\n\nPlans for human spaceflight began in the U.S. Armed Forces prior to NASA's creation. The Air Force's \n project formed in 1956,\n coupled with the Army's Project Adam, served as the foundation for \n. NASA established the \n to manage the program,\n which would conduct crewed sub-orbital flights with the Army's \n rockets and orbital flights with the Air Force's \n launch vehicles. While NASA intended for its first astronauts to be civilians, President Eisenhower directed that they be selected from the military. The \n astronauts included three Air Force pilots, three Navy aviators, and one Marine Corps pilot.\n\n\nOn May 5, 1961 \n became the first American to enter space, performing a suborbital spaceflight in the \n.\n This flight occurred less than a month after the Soviet \n became the first human in space, executing a full orbital spaceflight. NASA's first orbital spaceflight was conducted by \n on February 20, 1962, in the \n, making three full orbits before reentering. Glenn had to fly parts of his final two orbits manually due to an autopilot malfunction.\n The sixth and final Mercury mission was flown by \n in May 1963, performing 22 orbits over 34 hours in the \n.\n The Mercury Program was wildly recognized as a resounding success, achieving its objectives to orbit a human in space, develop tracking and control systems, and identify other issues associated with human spaceflight.\n\n\nWhile much of NASA's attention turned to space, it did not put aside its aeronautics mission. Early aeronautics research attempted to build upon the X-1's \n to build an aircraft capable of \n. The \n was a joint NASA-U.S. Air Force program,\n with the hypersonic test aircraft becoming the first non-dedicated spacecraft to cross from the atmosphere to outer space. The X-15 also served as a testbed for Apollo program technologies, as well as \n and \n propulsion.\n\n\nEscalations in the \n between the United States and Soviet Union prompted President \n to charge NASA with landing an American on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth by the end of the 1960s, and installed \n as NASA administrator to achieve this goal.\n On May\n25, 1961, President Kennedy openly declared this goal in his \"Urgent National Needs\" speech to the \n, declaring:\n\nI believe this Nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to Earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space; and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish.\nKennedy gave his \"\n\" speech the next year, on September\n12, 1962 at \n, where he addressed the nation hoping to reinforce public support for the Apollo program.\n\n\nDespite attacks on the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon from the former president Dwight Eisenhower and 1964 presidential candidate \n, President Kennedy was able to protect NASA's growing budget, of which 50% went directly to human spaceflight and it was later estimated that, at its height, 5% of Americans worked on some aspect of the Apollo program.\n\n\nMirroring the Department of Defense's program management concept using redundant systems in building the first intercontinental ballistic missiles, NASA requested the Air Force assign Major General \n to the space agency where he would serve as the director of the Apollo program. Development of the \n rocket was led by \n and his team at the \n, derived from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency's original \n. The \n was designed and built by \n, while the \n was designed and built by \n.\n\n\nTo develop the spaceflight skills and equipment required for a lunar mission, NASA initiated \n.\n Using a modified Air Force \n launch vehicle, the Gemini capsule could hold two astronauts for flights of over two weeks. Gemini pioneered the use of \n instead of batteries, and conducted the first American \n and \n.\n\nThe \n was started in the 1950s as a response to Soviet lunar exploration, however most missions ended in failure. The \n had greater success, mapping the surface in preparation for Apollo landings and measured \n, conducted meteoroid detection, and measured radiation levels. The \n conducted uncrewed lunar landings and takeoffs, as well as taking surface and regolith observations.\n Despite the setback caused by the \n fire, which killed three astronauts, the program proceeded.\n\n was the first crewed \n to leave \n and the first \n to reach the \n. The crew orbited the Moon ten times on December\n24 and\n25, 1968, and then traveled safely back to \n.\n The three Apollo\n8 astronauts—\n, \n, and \n—were the first humans to see the Earth as a globe in space, the first to witness an \n, and the first to see and manually photograph the far side of the Moon.\n\nThe first lunar landing was conducted by \n. Commanded by \n with astronauts \n and \n, Apollo\n11 was one of the most significant missions in NASA's history, marking the end of the Space Race when the Soviet Union gave up its lunar ambitions. As the first human to step on the surface of the Moon, Neil Armstrong uttered the now famous words:\n\nThat's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\nNASA would conduct six total lunar landings as part of the Apollo program, with \n concluding the program in 1972.\n\n\n had advocated for NASA to develop a space station since the agency was created. In 1973, following the end of the Apollo lunar missions, NASA launched its first space station, \n, on the final launch of the Saturn\nV. Skylab reused a significant amount of former Apollo and Saturn hardware, with a repurposed Saturn\nV third stage serving as the primary module for the space station. Damage to Skylab during launch required spacewalks by the first crew to make it habitable and operational. Skylab hosted 9 missions and was decommissioned in 1974 and deorbited in 1979, two years prior to the first launch of the \n and any possibility of boosting its orbit.\n\n\nIn 1975, the \n mission was the first ever international spaceflight and a major diplomatic accomplishment between the Cold War rivals, which also marked the last flight of the Apollo capsule.\n Flown in 1975, a U.S. Apollo spacecraft docked with a Soviet \n capsule.\n\nDuring the 1960s, NASA started its \n and interplanetary probe program. The \n was its flagship program, launching probes to \n, \n, and \n in the 1960s.\n The \n was the lead NASA center for robotic interplanetary exploration, making significant discoveries about the \n. Despite these successes, Congress was unwilling to fund further interplanetary missions and NASA Administrator James Webb suspended all future interplanetary probes to focus resources on the Apollo program.\n\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the Apollo program, NASA resumed launching interplanetary probes and expanded its \n program. The first planet tagged for exploration was \n, sharing many similar characteristics to Earth. First visited by American \n spacecraft,\n Venus was observed to be a hot and inhospitable planet. Follow-on missions included the \n in the 1970s and \n, which performed radar mapping of Venus' surface in the 1980s and 1990s. Future missions were flybys of Venus, on their way to other destinations in the Solar System.\n\n\n has long been a planet of intense fascination for NASA, being suspected of potentially having harbored life. \n was the first NASA spacecraft to flyby Mars,\n followed by \n and \n. \n was the first orbital mission to Mars. Launched in 1975, \n consisted of two landings on Mars in 1976. Follow-on missions would not be launched until 1996, with the \n orbiter and \n, deploying the first Mars rover, \n.\n During the early 2000s, the \n orbiter reached the planet and in 2004 the \n and \n rovers landed on the Red Planet. This was followed in 2005 by the \n and 2007 \n Mars lander. The 2012 landing of \n discovered that the radiation levels on Mars were equal to those on the \n, greatly increasing the possibility of Human exploration, and observed the key chemical ingredients for life to occur. In 2013, the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (\n) mission observed the Martian upper atmosphere and space environment and in 2018, the Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations Geodesy, and Heat Transport (\n) studied the Martian interior. The 2021 \n rover carried the first extraplanetary aircraft, a helicopter named \n.\n\n\nNASA also launched missions to \n in 2004, with the \n probe demonstrating as the first use of a \n.\n NASA also launched probes to the \n starting in the 1960s. \n was the first probe to the outer planets, flying by \n, while \n provided the first close up view of the planet. Both probes became the first objects to leave the Solar System. The \n launched in 1977, conducting flybys of \n and \n, \n, and \n on a trajectory to leave the Solar System.\n The \n spacecraft, deployed from the Space Shuttle flight \n, was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter, discovering evidence of subsurface oceans on the \n and observed that the moon may hold ice or liquid water.\n A joint NASA-\n-\n mission, \n, was sent to \n's moon \n, which, along with Mars and Europa, are the only celestial bodies in the Solar System suspected of being capable of harboring life.\n Cassini discovered three new moons of Saturn and the \n probe entered Titan's atmosphere. The mission discovered evidence of liquid hydrocarbon lakes on Titan and subsurface water oceans on the moon of \n, which could harbor life. Finally launched in 2006, the \n mission was the first spacecraft to visit \n and the \n.\n\n\nBeyond interplanetary probes, NASA has launched many \n. Launched in the 1960s, the \n were NASA's first orbital telescopes,\n providing ultraviolet, gamma-ray, x-ray, and infrared observations. NASA launched the \n in the 1960s and 1970s to look down at Earth and observe its interactions with the Sun. The \n satellite was the first dedicated x-ray telescope, mapping 85% of the sky and discovering a large number of \n.\n\n\nLaunched in the 1990s and early 2000s, the \n are among NASA's most powerful telescopes. The \n was launched in 1990 on \n from the \n and could view galaxies 15 billion light years away.\n A major defect in the telescope's mirror could have crippled the program, had NASA not used computer enhancement to compensate for the imperfection and launched five Space Shuttle servicing flights to replace the damaged components. The \n was launched from the \n on \n in 1991, discovering a possible source of \n at the center of the \n and observing that the majority of gamma-ray bursts occur outside of the Milky Way galaxy. The \n was launched from the \n on \n in 1999, observing black holes, \n, \n, and \n. It provided critical observations on the \n black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and the separation of dark and regular matter during galactic collisions. Finally, the \n is an infrared telescope launched in 2003 from a \n rocket. It is in a trailing orbit around the Sun, following the Earth and discovered the existence of \n.\n\n\nOther telescopes, such as the \n and the \n, provided evidence to support the \n.\n The \n, named after the NASA administrator who lead the Apollo program, is an infrared observatory launched in 2021. The James Webb Space Telescope is a direct successor to the Hubble Space Telescope, intended to observe the formation of the first galaxies.\n Other space telescopes include the \n, launched in 2009 to identify planets orbiting extrasolar stars that may be Terran and possibly harbor life. The first exoplanet that the Keplar space telescope confirmed was \n, orbiting within the habitable zone of its star.\n\n\nNASA also launched a number of different satellites to study Earth, such as \n (TIROS) in 1960, which was the first weather satellite.\n NASA and the \n cooperated on future TIROS and the second generation \n of weather satellites. It also worked with the \n on a series of weather satellites and the agency launched its experimental \n into geosynchronous orbit. NASA's first dedicated Earth observation satellite, \n, was launched in 1972. This led to NASA and the \n jointly developing the \n and discovering \n.\n\n\nNASA had been pursuing \n development since the 1960s, blending the administration's dual aeronautics and space missions. NASA viewed a spaceplane as part of a larger program, providing routine and economical logistical support to a \n in Earth orbit that would be used as a hub for lunar and Mars missions. A reusable launch vehicle would then have ended the need for expensive and expendable boosters like the Saturn V.\n\n\nIn 1969, NASA designated the \n as the lead center for developing the design, development, and manufacturing of the \n, while the \n would lead the development of the launch system. NASA's series of \n aircraft, culminating in the joint NASA-U.S. Air Force \n, directly informed the development of the Space Shuttle and future hypersonic flight aircraft. Official development of the \n began in 1972, with \n contracted to design the orbiter and engines, \n for the \n, and \n for the \n.\n NASA acquired six orbiters: the \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n\n\nThe Space Shuttle program also allowed NASA to make major changes to its \n. While almost all previous astronauts were Air Force or Naval test pilots, the Space Shuttle allowed NASA to begin recruiting more non-military scientific and technical experts. A prime example is \n, who became the first American woman to fly in space on \n. This new astronaut selection process also allowed NASA to accept exchange astronauts from U.S. allies and partners for the first time.\n\n\nThe first Space Shuttle flight occurred in 1981, when the \n launched on the \n mission, designed to serve as a flight test for the new spaceplane.\n NASA intended for the Space Shuttle to replace expendable launch systems like the Air Force's \n, \n, and \n and the \n's \n. The Space Shuttle's \n payload, developed by the \n, dramatically increased the scientific capabilities of shuttle missions over anything NASA was able to previously accomplish.\n\n\nNASA launched its first commercial satellites on the \n mission and in 1984, the \n mission conducted the world's first \n mission when the \n captured and repaired the malfunctioning \n satellite. It also had the capability to return malfunctioning satellite to Earth, like it did with the \n and \n satellites. Once returned to Earth, the satellites were repaired and relaunched.\n\n\nDespite ushering in a new era of spaceflight, where NASA was contracting launch services to commercial companies, the Space Shuttle was criticized for not being as reusable and cost-effective as advertised. In 1986, \n on the \n mission resulted in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts on launch, grounding the entire space shuttle fleet for 36 months and forced the 44 commercial companies that contracted with NASA to deploy their satellites to return to expendable launch vehicles.\n When the Space Shuttle returned to flight with the \n mission, it had undergone significant modifications to improve its reliability and safety.\n\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation and United States initiated the \n.\n The first Russian cosmonaut flew on the \n mission in 1994 and the \n rendezvoused, but did not dock with, the Russian \n in the \n mission. This was followed by \n \n mission where it accomplished the initial intended mission for the Space Shuttle, docking with a space station and transferring supplies and personnel. The Shuttle-\n program would continue until 1998, when a series of orbital accidents on the space station spelled an end to the program.\n\n\nIn 2003, a second space shuttle was destroyed when the \n was \n upon reentry during the \n mission, resulting in the loss of the spacecraft and all seven astronauts.\n This accident marked the beginning of the retiring of the Space Shuttle program, with President \n directing that upon the completion of the International Space Station, the space shuttle be retired. In 2006, the Space Shuttle returned to flight and flew several additional missions, flying several mission to service the \n, but was retired with the completion of the completion of the \n resupply mission to the International Space Station in 2011.\n\nNASA never gave up on the idea of a space station after Skylab's reentry in 1979. The agency began lobbing politicians to support building a space station as soon as the Space Shuttle began flying, selling it as an orbital laboratory, repair station, and a jumping off point for lunar and Mars missions. NASA found a strong advocate in President \n, who declared in a 1984 speech:\n\nAmerica has always been greatest when we dared to be great. We can reach for greatness again. We can follow our dreams to distant stars, living and working in space for peaceful, economic, and scientific gain. Tonight I am directing NASA to develop a permanently manned space station and to do it within a decade.\nIn 1985, NASA proposed the \n, which both the agency and President Reagan intended to be an international program. While this would add legitimacy to the program, there were concerns within NASA that the international component would dilute its authority within the project, having never been willing to work with domestic or international partners as true equals. There was also a concern with sharing sensitive space technologies with the Europeans, which had the potential to dilute America's technical lead. Ultimately, an international agreement to develop the Space Station \n program would be signed with thirteen countries in 1985, including the \n member states, Canada, and Japan.\n\n\nDespite its status as the first international space program, the Space Station \n was controversial, with much of the debate centering on cost. Several redesigns to reduce cost were conducted in the early 1990s, stripping away much of its functions. Despite calls for Congress to terminate the program, it continued, in large part because by 1992 it had created 75,000 jobs across 39 states. By 1993, President \n attempted to significantly reduce NASA's budget and directed costs be significantly reduced, aerospace industry jobs were not lost, and the Russians be included.\n\n\nIn 1993, the Clinton Administration announced that the Space Station \n would become the \n in an agreement with the Russian Federation. This allowed the Russians to maintain their space program through an infusion of American currency to maintain their status as one of the two premier space programs. While the United States built and launched the majority of the International Space Station, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the European Space Agency all contributed components. Despite NASA's insistence that costs would be kept at a budget of $17.4, they kept rising and NASA had to transfer funds from other programs to keep the International Space Station solvent. Ultimately, the total cost of the station was $150 billion, with the United States paying for two-thirds.Following the Space Shuttle \n disaster in 2003, NASA was forced to rely on Russian \n launches for its astronauts and the 2011 retirement of the Space Shuttle accelerated the station's completion.\n\n\nIn the 1980s, right after the first flight of the Space Shuttle, NASA started a joint program with the Department of Defense to develop the \n National Aerospace Plane. NASA realized that the Space Shuttle, while a massive technological accomplishment, would not be able to live up to all its promises. Designed to be a \n spaceplane, the X-30 had both civil and military applications. With the end of the \n, the X-30 was canceled in 1992 before reaching flight status.\n\n\nFollowing the 2003 Space Shuttle \n disaster, President Bush started the \n to smoothly replace the Space Shuttle and expand space exploration beyond low Earth orbit. Constellation was intended to use a significant amount of former Space Shuttle equipment and return astronauts to the Moon. This program was canceled by the \n and former astronauts \n, \n, and \n sent a letter to President \n to warn him that if the United States did not get new human spaceflight ability, the U.S. risked become a second or third-rate space power.\n\n\nAs early as the Reagan Administration, there had been calls for NASA to expand private sector involvement in space exploration rather than do it all in house. In the 1990s, NASA and Lockheed Martin entered into an agreement to develop the \n and \n spaceplane, which was intended to replace the Space Shuttle. Due to technical challenges, the spacecraft was cancelled in 2001. Despite this, it was the first time a commercial space company directly expended a significant amount of its own resources into spacecraft development. The advent of \n also forced NASA to challenge its assumption that only governments would have people in space. The first space tourist was \n, an American investment manager and former aerospace engineer who contracted with the Russians to fly to the International Space Station for four days, despite the opposition of NASA to the idea.\n\n\nAdvocates of this new commercial approach for NASA included former astronaut \n, who remarked that it would return NASA to its roots as a research and development agency, with commercial entities actually operating the space systems. Having corporations take over orbital operations would also allow NASA to focus all its efforts on deep space exploration and returning humans to the Moon and going to Mars. Embracing this approach, NASA's \n started by contracting cargo delivery to the International Space Station and flew its first operational contracted mission on \n. This marked the first time since the retirement of the Space Shuttle that NASA was able to launch its own astronauts on an American spacecraft from the United States, ending a decade of reliance on the Russians.\n\n\nIn 2019, NASA announced the \n, intending to return to the Moon and establish a permanent human presence.\n This was paired with the \n with partner nations to establish rules of behavior and norms of space commercialization on the Moon.\n\n\nThe \n (ISS) combines NASA's \n project with the Soviet/Russian \n station, the European \n station, and the Japanese \n laboratory module.\n NASA originally planned in the 1980s to develop \n alone, but US budget constraints led to the merger of these projects into a single multi-national program in 1993, managed by NASA, the \n (RKA), the \n (JAXA), the \n (ESA), and the \n (CSA).\n The station consists of pressurized modules, external \n, \n and other components, which were \n in various factories around the world, and have been launched by Russian \n and \n rockets, and the US Space Shuttles.\n The on-orbit assembly began in 1998, the completion of the \n occurred in 2009 and the completion of the \n occurred in 2010, though there are some debates of whether new modules should be added in the segment. The ownership and use of the space station is established in intergovernmental treaties and agreements\n which divide the station into two areas and allow \n to retain full ownership of the Russian Orbital Segment (with the exception of \n),\n with the US Orbital Segment allocated between the other international partners.\n\n\nLong-duration missions to the ISS are referred to as \n. Expedition crew members typically spend approximately six months on the ISS.\n The initial expedition crew size was three, temporarily decreased to two following the \n disaster. Since May 2009, expedition crew size has been six crew members.\n Crew size is expected to be increased to seven, the number the ISS was designed for, once the Commercial Crew Program becomes operational.\n The ISS has been continuously occupied for the past 23 years and 186 days, having exceeded the previous record held by \n; and has been visited by astronauts and cosmonauts from \n.\n\n\nThe station can be seen from the Earth with the naked eye and, as of 2024, is the largest artificial satellite in Earth orbit with a mass and volume greater than that of any previous space station.\n The Russian \n and American \n spacecraft are used to send astronauts to and from the ISS. Several uncrewed cargo spacecraft provide service to the ISS; they are the Russian \n which has done so since 2000, the European \n (ATV) since 2008, the Japanese \n (HTV) since 2009, the (uncrewed) \n since 2012, and the American \n since 2013.\n The Space Shuttle, before its retirement, was also used for cargo transfer and would often switch out expedition crew members, although it did not have the capability to remain docked for the duration of their stay. Between the retirement of the Shuttle in 2011 and the commencement of crewed Dragon flights in 2020, American astronauts exclusively used the Soyuz for crew transport to and from the ISS\n The highest number of people occupying the ISS has been thirteen; this occurred three times during the late Shuttle ISS assembly missions.\n\n\nThe ISS program is expected to continue to 2030,\n after which the space station will be retired and destroyed in a controlled de-orbit.\n\n\nCommercial Resupply Services (CRS) are a contract solution to deliver cargo and supplies to the \n (ISS) on a commercial basis.\n NASA signed its first CRS contracts in 2008 and awarded $1.6 billion to \n for twelve cargo \n and $1.9 billion to \n for eight \n flights, covering deliveries to 2016. Both companies evolved or created their launch vehicle products to support the solution (SpaceX with The \n and Orbital with the \n).\n\nSpaceX flew its first operational resupply mission (\n) in 2012.\n Orbital Sciences followed in 2014 (\n).\n In 2015, NASA extended CRS-1 to twenty flights for SpaceX and twelve flights for \n.\n\n\nA second phase of contracts (known as CRS-2) was solicited in 2014; contracts were awarded in January 2016 to Orbital ATK\n \n, \n \n, and SpaceX \n, for cargo transport flights beginning in 2019 and expected to last through 2024. In March 2022, NASA awarded an additional six CRS-2 missions each to both SpaceX and Northrop Grumman (formerly Orbital).\n\n\n successfully delivered \n to the ISS in February 2022.\n In July 2022, SpaceX launched its 25th CRS flight (\n) and successfully delivered its cargo to the ISS.\n In late 2022, Sierra Nevada continued to assemble their Dream Chaser CRS solution; current estimates put its first launch in early 2023.\n\n\nThe Commercial Crew Program (CCP) provides \n \n to and from the \n (ISS) under contract to NASA, conducting crew rotations between the \n of the \n. American \n \n began providing service in 2020, using the \n spacecraft,\n and NASA plans to add \n when its \n spacecraft becomes operational some time after 2024.\n NASA has contracted for six operational missions from Boeing and fourteen from SpaceX, ensuring sufficient support for ISS through 2030.\n\n\nThe spacecraft are owned and operated by the vendor, and crew transportation is provided to NASA as a commercial service. Each mission sends up to four astronauts to the ISS, with an option for a fifth passenger available. Operational flights occur approximately once every six months for missions that last for approximately six months. A spacecraft remains docked to the ISS during its mission, and missions usually overlap by at least a few days. Between the retirement of the \n in 2011 and the first operational CCP mission in 2020, NASA relied on the \n to transport its astronauts to the ISS.\n\nA Crew Dragon spacecraft is launched to space atop a \n launch vehicle and the capsule returns to Earth via \n in the ocean near Florida. The program's first operational mission, \n, launched on November 16, 2020.\n \n operational flights will now commence after its \n which was launched atop an \n N22 launch vehicle. Instead of a splashdown, a Starliner capsule returns on land with \n at one of four designated sites in the western United States.\n\n\nSince 2017, NASA's \n has been the \n, which involves the help of US \n and international partners such as \n, \n, and \n.\n The goal of this program is to land \"the first woman and the next man\" on the \n region by 2025. Artemis would be the first step towards the long-term goal of establishing a sustainable presence on the Moon, laying the foundation for companies to build a lunar economy, and eventually sending humans to \n.\n\nThe \n Crew Exploration Vehicle was held over from the canceled Constellation program for Artemis. \n was the uncrewed initial launch of \n (SLS) that would also send an Orion spacecraft on a \n.\n\n\nNASA's next major space initiative is to be the construction of the \n, a small space station in lunar orbit.\n This space station will be designed primarily for non-continuous human habitation. The first tentative steps of returning to crewed lunar missions will be \n, which is to include the Orion crew module, propelled by the SLS, and is to launch in 2025.\n This mission is to be a 10-day mission planned to briefly place a crew of four into a \n.\n The construction of the Gateway would begin with the proposed Artemis 3, which is planned to deliver a crew of four to \n along with the first modules of the Gateway. This mission would last for up to 30 days. NASA plans to build full scale deep space habitats such as the Lunar Gateway and the \n as part of its \n (NextSTEP) program.\n In 2017, NASA was directed by the congressional NASA Transition Authorization Act of 2017 to get humans to Mars-orbit (or to the Martian surface) by the 2030s.\n\n\nIn support of the Artemis missions, NASA has been funding private companies to land robotic probes on the lunar surface in a program known as the \n. As of March 2022, NASA has awarded contracts for robotic lunar probes to companies such as \n, \n, and \n.\n\n\nOn April 16, 2021, NASA announced they had selected the \n as its Human Landing System. The agency's Space Launch System rocket will launch four astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft for their multi-day journey to lunar orbit where they will transfer to SpaceX's Starship for the final leg of their journey to the surface of the Moon.\n\n\nIn November 2021, it was announced that the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by 2024 had slipped to no earlier than 2025 due to numerous factors. \n launched on November 16, 2022, and returned to Earth safely on December 11, 2022. As of April 2024, NASA plans to launch \n in September 2025\n and \n in September 2026.\n Additional Artemis missions, \n, \n, and Artemis 6 are planned to launch between 2028 and 2031.\n\n\nThe Commercial Low Earth Orbit Destinations program is an initiative by NASA to support work on commercial space stations that the agency hopes to have in place by the end of the current decade to replace the \"International Space Station\". The three selected companies are: \n (et al.) with their \n station concept, \n (et al.) with their \n concept, and \n with a station concept based on the HALO-module for the Gateway station.\n\n\nNASA has conducted many uncrewed and robotic spaceflight programs throughout its history. More than 1,000 uncrewed missions have been designed to explore the Earth and the Solar System.\n\n\nNASA executes a mission development framework to plan, select, develop, and operate robotic missions. This framework defines cost, schedule and technical risk parameters to enable competitive selection of missions involving mission candidates that have been developed by principal investigators and their teams from across NASA, the broader U.S. Government research and development stakeholders, and industry. The mission development construct is defined by four umbrella programs.\n\nThe Explorer program derives its origin from the earliest days of the U.S. Space program. In current form, the program consists of three classes of systems – \n, \n, and \n missions. The NASA Explorer program office provides frequent flight opportunities for moderate cost innovative solutions from the heliophysics and astrophysics science areas. The Small Explorer missions are required to limit cost to NASA to below $150M (2022 dollars). Medium class explorer missions have typically involved NASA cost caps of $350M. The Explorer program office is based at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\n\nThe NASA Discovery program develops and delivers robotic spacecraft solutions in the planetary science domain. Discovery enables scientists and engineers to assemble a team to deliver a solution against a defined set of objectives and competitively bid that solution against other candidate programs. Cost caps vary but recent mission selection processes were accomplished using a $500M cost cap for NASA. The Planetary Mission Program Office is based at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center and manages both the Discovery and New Frontiers missions. The office is part of the Science Mission Directorate.\n\n\nNASA Administrator Bill Nelson announced on June 2, 2021, that the \n and \n missions were selected to launch to Venus in the late 2020s, having beat out competing proposals for missions to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io and Neptune's large moon \n that were also selected as Discovery program finalists in early 2020. Each mission has an estimated cost of $500 million, with launches expected between 2028 and 2030. Launch contracts will be awarded later in each mission's development.\n\n\nThe New Frontiers program focuses on specific \n exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Primary objectives include Solar System exploration employing medium class spacecraft missions to conduct high-science-return investigations. New Frontiers builds on the development approach employed by the Discovery program but provides for higher cost caps and schedule durations than are available with Discovery. Cost caps vary by opportunity; recent missions have been awarded based on a defined cap of $1 billion. The higher cost cap and projected longer mission durations result in a lower frequency of new opportunities for the program – typically one every several years. \n and \n are examples of New Frontiers missions.\n\n\nNASA has determined that the next opportunity to propose for the fifth round of New Frontiers missions will occur no later than the fall of 2024. Missions in NASA's New Frontiers Program tackle specific Solar System exploration goals identified as top priorities by the planetary science community. Exploring the Solar System with medium-class spacecraft missions that conduct high-science-return investigations is NASA's strategy to further understand the Solar System.\n\n\nLarge strategic missions (formerly called Flagship missions) are strategic missions that are typically developed and managed by large teams that may span several NASA centers. The individual missions become the program as opposed to being part of a larger effort (see Discovery, New Frontiers, etc.). The \n is a strategic mission that was developed over a period of more than 20 years. Strategic missions are developed on an ad-hoc basis as program objectives and priorities are established. Missions like Voyager, had they been developed today, would have been strategic missions. Three of the Great Observatories were strategic missions (the \n, the \n, and the \n). \n is the next large strategic mission in development by NASA.\n\nNASA continues to play a material role in exploration of the Solar System as it has for decades. Ongoing missions have current science objectives with respect to more than five extraterrestrial bodies within the Solar System – Moon (\n), Mars (\n rover), Jupiter (\n), asteroid \n (\n), and Kuiper Belt Objects (\n). The \n extended mission will make multiple flybys of the Jovian moon Io in 2023 and 2024 after flybys of \n in 2021 and \n in 2022. \n and \n continue to provide science data back to Earth while continuing on their outward journeys into interstellar space.\n\nOn November 26, 2011, NASA's \n mission was successfully launched for Mars. The \n rover successfully landed on Mars on August 6, 2012, and subsequently began its search for evidence of past or present life on Mars.\n\n\nIn September 2014, NASA's \n spacecraft, which is part of the \n, successfully entered Mars orbit and, as of October 2022, continues its study of the \n.\n NASA's ongoing Mars investigations include in-depth surveys of Mars by the \n rover and \n).\n\nNASA's \n, planned for launch in October 2024, will study the Galilean moon Europa through a series of flybys while in orbit around Jupiter. \n will send a mobile robotic \n to Saturn's biggest moon, \n.\n As of May 2021, \n is scheduled for launch in June 2027.\n\n\nThe NASA Science Mission Directorate Astrophysics division manages the agency's astrophysics science portfolio. NASA has invested significant resources in the development, delivery, and operations of various forms of space telescopes. These telescopes have provided the means to study the cosmos over a large range of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\n\nThe Great Observatories that were launched in the 1980s and 1990s have provided a wealth of observations for study by physicists across the planent. The first of them, the \n, was delivered to orbit in 1990 and continues to function, in part due to prior servicing missions performed by the Space Shuttle.\n The other remaining active great observatories include the \n (CXO), launched by \n in July 1999 and is now in a 64-hour \n studying X-ray sources that are not readily viewable from terrestrial observatories.\n\n\nThe \n (IXPE) is a space observatory designed to improve the understanding of X-ray production in objects such as neutron stars and pulsar wind nebulae, as well as stellar and supermassive black holes.\n IXPE launched in December 2021 and is an international collaboration between NASA and the \n (ASI). It is part of the NASA \n (SMEX) which designs low-cost spacecraft to study heliophysics and astrophysics.\n\n\nThe \n was launched in November 2004 and is Gamma-ray burst observatory that also monitors the afterglow in X-ray, and UV/Visible light at the location of a burst.\n The mission was developed in a joint partnership between \n (GSFC) and an international consortium from the United States, United Kingdom, and Italy. \n operates the mission as part of NASA's \n (MIDEX).\n\n\nThe \n (FGST) is another gamma-ray focused space observatory that was launched to \n in June 2008 and is being used to perform \n observations.\n In addition to NASA, the mission involves the \n, and government agencies in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Sweden.\n\n\nThe \n (JWST), launched in December 2021 on an \n rocket, operates in a \n circling the Sun-Earth \n point.\n JWST's high sensitivity in the infrared spectrum and its imaging resolution will allow it to view more distant, faint, or older objects than its predecessors, including Hubble.\n\n\nNASA Earth Science is a large, umbrella program comprising a range of terrestrial and space-based collection systems in order to better understand the Earth system and its response to natural and human-caused changes. Numerous systems have been developed and fielded over several decades to provide improved prediction for weather, climate, and other changes in the natural environment. Several of the current operating spacecraft programs include: \n,\n \n,\n \n (OCO-2),\n \n,\n and \n.\n\n\nIn addition to systems already in orbit, NASA is designing a new set of Earth Observing Systems to study, assess, and generate responses for climate change, natural hazards, forest fires, and real-time agricultural processes.\n The GOES-T satellite (designated \n after launch) joined the fleet of U.S. geostationary weather monitoring satellites in March 2022.\n\n\nNASA also maintains the Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) program to oversee the life cycle of NASA's Earth science data — from acquisition through processing and distribution. The primary goal of ESDS is to maximize the scientific return from NASA's missions and experiments for research and applied scientists, decision makers, and society at large.\n\n\nThe Earth Science program is managed by the Earth Science Division of the NASA Science Mission Directorate.\n\nNASA invests in various ground and space-based infrastructures to support its science and exploration mandate. The agency maintains access to suborbital and orbital space launch capabilities and sustains ground station solutions to support its evolving fleet of spacecraft and remote systems.\n\nThe \n (\n) serves as the primary ground station solution for NASA's interplanetary spacecraft and select Earth-orbiting missions.\n The system employs ground station complexes near Barstow California in the United States, in Spain near Madrid, and in Australia near Canberra. The placement of these ground stations approximately 120 degrees apart around the planet provides the ability for communications to spacecraft throughout the \n even as the Earth rotates about its axis on a daily basis. The system is controlled at a 24x7 operations center at JPL in Pasadena California which manages recurring communications linkages with up to 40 spacecraft.\n The system is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).\n\n\nThe Near Space Network (NSN) provides telemetry, commanding, ground-based tracking, data and communications services to a wide range of customers with satellites in low earth orbit (LEO), geosynchronous orbit (GEO), highly elliptical orbits (HEO), and lunar orbits. The NSN accumulates ground station and antenna assets from the Near-Earth Network and the \n (\n) which operates in geosynchronous orbit providing continuous real-time coverage for launch vehicles and low earth orbit NASA missions.\n\n\nThe NSN consists of 19 ground stations worldwide operated by the US Government and by contractors including Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), Swedish Space Corporation (SSC), and South African National Space Agency (SANSA).\n The ground network averages between 120 and 150 spacecraft contacts a day with TDRS engaging with systems on a near-continuous basis as needed; the system is managed and operated by the Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\n\nThe \n (\n) is located at the \n and provides launch capability, payload development and integration, and field operations support to execute suborbital missions.\n The program has been in operation since 1959 and is managed by the Goddard Space Flight Center using a combined US Government and contractor team.\n The NSRP team conducts approximately 20 missions per year from both Wallops and other launch locations worldwide to allow scientists to collect data \"where it occurs\". The program supports the strategic vision of the Science Mission Directorate collecting important scientific data for earth science, heliophysics, and astrophysics programs.\n\n\nIn June 2022, NASA conducted its first rocket launch from a commercial spaceport outside the US. It launched a \n from the \n in Australia.\n\n\nThe NASA Launch Services Program (LSP) is responsible for procurement of launch services for NASA uncrewed missions and oversight of launch integration and launch preparation activity, providing added quality and mission assurance to meet program objectives.\n Since 1990, NASA has purchased \n directly from commercial providers, whenever possible, for its scientific and applications missions. Expendable launch vehicles can accommodate all types of orbit inclinations and altitudes and are ideal vehicles for launching Earth-orbit and interplanetary missions. LSP operates from Kennedy Space Center and falls under the NASA Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD).\n\n\nThe \n (\n) is one of five mission \n within NASA, the other four being the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, the Space Operations Mission Directorate, the \n, and the Space Technology Mission Directorate.\n The ARMD is responsible for NASA's \n research, which benefits the \n, \n, and \n sectors. ARMD performs its aeronautics research at four NASA facilities: \n and \n in California, \n in Ohio, and \n in Virginia.\n\n\nThe \n is an experimental aircraft being developed by NASA to demonstrate the technologies required to deliver a highly efficient all-electric aircraft.\n The primary goal of the program is to develop and deliver all-electric technology solutions that can also achieve airworthiness certification with regulators. The program involves development of the system in several phases, or modifications, to incrementally grow the capability and operability of the system. The initial configuration of the aircraft has now completed ground testing as it approaches its first flights. In mid-2022, the X-57 was scheduled to fly before the end of the year.\n The development team includes staff from the NASA Armstrong, Glenn, and Langley centers along with number of industry partners from the United States and Italy.\n\n\nNASA is collaborating with the \n and industry stakeholders to modernize the United States \n (NAS). Efforts began in 2007 with a goal to deliver major modernization components by 2025.\n The modernization effort intends to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the \n.\n The Aviation Systems Division of NASA Ames operates the joint NASA/FAA North Texas Research Station. The station supports all phases of NextGen research, from concept development to prototype system field evaluation. This facility has already transitioned advanced NextGen concepts and technologies to use through technology transfers to the FAA.\n NASA contributions also include development of advanced automation concepts and tools that provide air traffic controllers, pilots, and other airspace users with more accurate real-time information about the nation's traffic flow, weather, and routing. Ames' advanced airspace modeling and simulation tools have been used extensively to model the flow of air traffic flow across the U.S., and to evaluate new concepts in airspace design, traffic flow management, and optimization.\n\n\nNASA has made use of technologies such as the \n (MMRTG), which is a type of \n used to power spacecraft.\n Shortages of the required \n have curtailed deep space missions since the turn of the millennium.\n An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was \n.\n\n\nIn July 2021, NASA announced contract awards for development of \n reactors. Three contractors will develop individual designs over 12 months for later evaluation by NASA and the \n.\n NASA's space nuclear technologies portfolio are led and funded by its Space Technology Mission Directorate.\n\nIn January 2023, NASA announced a partnership with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on the Demonstration Rocket for Agile Cislunar Operations (DRACO) program to demonstrate a NTR engine in space, an enabling capability for NASA missions to Mars.\n In July 2023, NASA and DARPA jointly announced the award of $499 million to Lockheed Martin to design and build an experimental NTR rocket to be launched in 2027.\n\n\n. NASA contracted a third party to study the probability of using Free Space Optics (FSO) to communicate with Optical (\n) Stations on the Ground (OGS) called laser-com \n networks for satellite communications.\n\n\n. On July 29, 2020, NASA requested American universities to propose new technologies for extracting water from the \n and developing power systems. The idea will help the space agency conduct \n exploration of the Moon.\n\n\nIn 2024, NASA was tasked by the \n to create a \n for the \n. The standard is to be called \n and is expected to be finalized in 2026.\n\n\nNASA's \n (HRP) is designed to study the effects of space on human health and also to provide countermeasures and technologies for human space exploration. The medical effects of space exploration are reasonably limited in low Earth orbit or in travel to the Moon. Travel to Mars is significantly longer and deeper into space, significant medical issues can result. These include bone density loss, radiation exposure, vision changes, circadian rhythm disturbances, heart remodeling, and immune alterations. In order to study and diagnose these ill-effects, HRP has been tasked with identifying or developing small portable instrumentation with low mass, volume, and power to monitor the health of astronauts.\n To achieve this aim, on May 13, 2022, NASA and \n astronauts successfully tested its rHEALTH ONE universal biomedical analyzer for its ability to identify and analyzer biomarkers, cells, microorganisms, and proteins in a spaceflight environment.\n\n\nNASA established the Planetary Defense Coordination Office (\n) in 2016 to catalog and track potentially hazardous \n (NEO), such as \n and \n and develop potential responses and defenses against these threats.\n The PDCO is chartered to provide timely and accurate information to the government and the public on close approaches by \n (PHOs) and any potential for impact. The office functions within the Science Mission Directorate Planetary Science division.\n\n\nThe PDCO augmented prior cooperative actions between the United States, the European Union, and other nations which had been scanning the sky for NEOs since 1998 in an effort called \n.\n\n\nFrom the 1990s NASA has run many NEO detection programs from Earth bases observatories, greatly increasing the number of objects that have been detected. Many asteroids are very dark and those near the Sun are much harder to detect from Earth-based telescopes which observe at night, and thus face away from the Sun. NEOs inside Earth orbit only reflect a part of light also rather than potentially a \"full Moon\" when they are behind the Earth and fully lit by the Sun.\n\nIn 1998, the \n gave NASA a mandate to detect 90% of near-Earth asteroids over 1 km (0.62 mi) diameter (that threaten global devastation) by 2008.\n This initial mandate was met by 2011.\n In 2005, the original USA Spaceguard mandate was extended by the \n Near-Earth Object Survey Act, which calls for NASA to detect 90% of NEOs with diameters of 140 m (460 ft) or greater, by 2020 (compare to the 20-meter \n that hit Russia in 2013).\n As of January 2020\n, it is estimated that less than half of these have been found, but objects of this size hit the Earth only about once in 2,000 years.\n\n\nIn January 2020, NASA officials estimated it would take 30 years to find all objects meeting the 140 m (460 ft) size criteria, more than twice the timeframe that was built into the 2005 mandate.\n In June 2021, NASA authorized the development of the \n spacecraft to reduce that projected duration to achieve the mandate down to 10 years.\n\n\nNASA has incorporated planetary defense objectives into several ongoing missions.\n\nIn 1999, NASA visited \n with the \n spacecraft which entered its orbit in 2000, closely imaging the asteroid with various instruments at that time.\n \n became the first spacecraft to successfully orbit and land on an asteroid, improving our understanding of these bodies and demonstrating our capacity to study them in greater detail.\n\n\n used its suite of instruments to transmit radio tracking signals and capture optical images of \n during its study of the asteroid that will help NASA scientists determine its precise position in the solar system and its exact orbital path. As Bennu has the potential for recurring approaches to the Earth-Moon system in the next 100–200 years, the precision gained from OSIRIS-REx will enable scientists to better predict the future gravitational interactions between Bennu and our planet and resultant changes in Bennu's onward flight path.\n\n\nThe \n mission was launched by NASA JPL in 2009 as an infrared-wavelength astronomical space telescope. In 2013, NASA repurposed it as the NEOWISE mission to find potentially hazardous near-Earth asteroids and comets; its mission has been extended into 2023.\n\n\nNASA and \n (JHAPL) jointly developed the first planetary defense purpose-built satellite, the \n (DART) to test possible planetary defense concepts.\n DART was launched in November 2021 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 from California on a trajectory designed to impact the \n asteroid. Scientists were seeking to determine whether an impact could alter the subsequent path of the asteroid; a concept that could be applied to future planetary defense.\n On September 26, 2022, DART hit its target. In the weeks following impact, NASA declared DART a success, confirming it had shortened Dimorphos' orbital period around Didymos by about 32 minutes, surpassing the pre-defined success threshold of 73 seconds.\n\n\n, formerly called the Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam) mission, is a space-based \n under development to survey the \n for \n.\n The spacecraft is scheduled to launch in 2026.\n\nIn June 2022, the head of the NASA \n, \n, confirmed the start of \n.\n At a speech before the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine, Zurbuchen said the space agency would bring a scientific perspective to efforts already underway by the Pentagon and intelligence agencies to make sense of dozens of such sightings. He said it was \"high-risk, high-impact\" research that the space agency should not shy away from, even if it is a controversial field of study.\n\n\nIn response to the \n accident, which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise the NASA Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's air and space programs. In the aftermath of the \n, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to the NASA Administrator and to Congress.\n By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form the NASA Advisory Council (NAC).\n The \n reaffirmed the importance of ASAP.\n\nNASA and NOAA have cooperated for decades on the development, delivery and operation of polar and geosynchronous weather satellites.\n The relationship typically involves NASA developing the space systems, launch solutions, and ground control technology for the satellites and NOAA operating the systems and delivering weather forecasting products to users. Multiple generations of NOAA Polar orbiting platforms have operated to provide detailed imaging of weather from low altitude.\n \n (GOES) provide near-real-time coverage of the western hemisphere to ensure accurate and timely understanding of developing weather phenomenon.\n\n\nThe \n (USSF) is the space service branch of the \n, while the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is an independent agency of the United States government responsible for civil spaceflight. NASA and the Space Force's predecessors in the Air Force have a long-standing cooperative relationship, with the Space Force supporting NASA launches out of \n, \n, and \n, to include range support and rescue operations from Task Force 45.\n NASA and the Space Force also partner on matters such as defending Earth from asteroids.\n Space Force members can be NASA astronauts, with Colonel \n, the commander of \n, commissioned into the Space Force from the \n on December 18, 2020.\n In September 2020, the Space Force and NASA signed a \n formally acknowledging the joint role of both agencies. This new memorandum replaced a similar document signed in 2006 between NASA and Air Force Space Command.\n\n\nThe \n is the longest-running enterprise for acquisition of \n of Earth. It is a joint NASA / \n program.\n On July 23, 1972, the \n was launched. This was eventually renamed to \n in 1975.\n The most recent satellite in the series, \n, was launched on September 27, 2021.\n\n\nThe instruments on the Landsat satellites have acquired millions of images. The images, archived in the \n and at Landsat receiving stations around the world, are a unique resource for global change research and applications in \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n, and can be viewed through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) \"EarthExplorer\" website. The collaboration between NASA and USGS involves NASA designing and delivering the space system (satellite) solution, launching the satellite into orbit with the USGS operating the system once in orbit.\n As of October 2022, nine satellites have been built with eight of them successfully operating in orbit.\n\nNASA collaborates with the European Space Agency on a wide range of scientific and exploration requirements.\n From participation with the Space Shuttle (the Spacelab missions) to major roles on the Artemis program (the Orion Service Module), ESA and NASA have supported the science and exploration missions of each agency. There are NASA payloads on ESA spacecraft and ESA payloads on NASA spacecraft. The agencies have developed joint missions in areas including heliophysics (e.g. \n)\n and astronomy (\n, \n).\n\n\nUnder the Artemis Gateway partnership, ESA will contribute habitation and refueling modules, along with enhanced lunar communications, to the Gateway.\n NASA and ESA continue to advance cooperation in relation to Earth Science including climate change with agreements to cooperate on various missions including the \n series of spacecraft\n\n\nNASA and the \n (JAXA) cooperate on a range of space projects. JAXA is a direct participant in the Artemis program, including the Lunar Gateway effort. JAXA's planned contributions to Gateway include I-Hab's environmental control and life support system, batteries, thermal control, and imagery components, which will be integrated into the module by the European Space Agency (ESA) prior to launch. These capabilities are critical for sustained Gateway operations during crewed and uncrewed time periods.\n\n\nJAXA and NASA have collaborated on numerous satellite programs, especially in areas of Earth science. NASA has contributed to JAXA satellites and vice versa. Japanese instruments are flying on NASA's \n and \n satellites, and NASA sensors have flown on previous Japanese Earth-observation missions. The NASA-JAXA \n mission was launched in 2014 and includes both NASA- and JAXA-supplied sensors on a NASA satellite launched on a JAXA rocket. The mission provides the frequent, accurate measurements of rainfall over the entire globe for use by scientists and weather forecasters.\n\n\nNASA and Roscosmos have cooperated on the development and operation of the International Space Station since September 1993.\n The agencies have used launch systems from both countries to deliver station elements to orbit. Astronauts and Cosmonauts jointly maintain various elements of the station. Both countries provide access to the station via launch systems noting Russia's unique role as the sole provider of delivery of crew and cargo upon retirement of the space shuttle in 2011 and prior to commencement of NASA COTS and crew flights. In July 2022, NASA and Roscosmos signed a deal to share space station flights enabling crew from each country to ride on the systems provided by the other.\n Current geopolitical conditions in late 2022 make it unlikely that cooperation will be extended to other programs such as Artemis or lunar exploration.\n\n\nIn September 2014, NASA and \n signed a partnership to collaborate on and launch a joint radar mission, the \n (\n) mission. The mission is targeted to launch in 2024. NASA will provide the mission's L-band synthetic aperture radar, a high-rate communication subsystem for science data, GPS receivers, a solid-state recorder and payload data subsystem. ISRO provides the spacecraft bus, the S-band radar, the launch vehicle and associated launch services.\n\n\nThe \n have been established to define a framework for cooperating in the peaceful exploration and exploitation of the \n, \n, \n, and \n. The Accords were drafted by NASA and the U.S. State Department and are executed as a series of bilateral agreements between the United States and the participating countries.\n As of September 2022, 21 countries have signed the accords. They are Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, France, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Ukraine, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\nThe Wolf Amendment was passed by the U.S. Congress into law in 2011 and prevents NASA from engaging in direct, bilateral cooperation with the Chinese government and China-affiliated organizations such as the China National Space Administration without the explicit authorization from Congress and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The law has been renewed annually since by inclusion in annual appropriations bills.\n\n\nThe agency's administration is located at \n in Washington, DC, and provides overall guidance and direction.\n Except under exceptional circumstances, NASA civil service employees are required to be \n.\n\nNASA's administrator is nominated by the President of the United States subject to the approval of the \n,\n and serves at the President's pleasure as a senior space science advisor. The current administrator is \n, appointed by President \n, since May 3, 2021.\n\n\nNASA operates with four FY2022 strategic goals.\n\n\nNASA budget requests are developed by NASA and approved by the administration prior to submission to the \n. Authorized budgets are those that have been included in enacted appropriations bills that are approved by both houses of Congress and enacted into law by the U.S. president.\n\n\nNASA fiscal year budget requests and authorized budgets are provided below.\n\nNASA funding and priorities are developed through its six Mission Directorates.\n\nCenter-wide activities such as the Chief Engineer and Safety and Mission Assurance organizations are aligned to the headquarters function. The MSD budget estimate includes funds for these HQ functions. The administration operates 10 major field centers with several managing additional subordinate facilities across the country. Each is led by a Center Director (data below valid as of September 1, 2022).\n\nThe exhaust gases produced by rocket propulsion systems, both in Earth's atmosphere and in space, can adversely affect the Earth's environment. Some \n rocket propellants, such as \n, are highly toxic prior to \n, but decompose into less toxic compounds after burning. Rockets using hydrocarbon fuels, such as \n, release carbon dioxide and soot in their exhaust.\n Carbon dioxide emissions are insignificant compared to those from other sources; on average, the United States consumed 803 million US gal (3.0 million m\n) of liquid fuels per day in 2014, while a single \n rocket first stage burns around 25,000 US gallons (95 m\n) of \n fuel per launch.\n Even if a Falcon 9 were launched every single day, it would only represent 0.006% of liquid fuel consumption (and carbon dioxide emissions) for that day. Additionally, the exhaust from \n- and \n- fueled engines, like the \n, is almost entirely water vapor.\n NASA addressed environmental concerns with its canceled \n in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act in 2011.\n In contrast, \n use harmless noble gases like \n for propulsion.\n\n\nAn example of NASA's environmental efforts is the \n. Additionally, the Exploration Sciences Building was awarded the LEED Gold rating in 2010.\n On May 8, 2003, the \n recognized NASA as the first federal agency to directly use \n to produce energy at one of its facilities—the \n, Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\n\nIn 2018, NASA along with other companies including Sensor Coating Systems, \n, Monitor Coating and \n launched the project CAUTION (CoAtings for Ultra High Temperature detectION). This project aims to enhance the temperature range of the \n up to 1,500 °C (2,730 °F) and beyond. The final goal of this project is improving the safety of jet engines as well as increasing efficiency and reducing CO\n emissions.\n\n\nNASA also researches and publishes on \n.\n Its statements concur with the global scientific consensus that the global climate is warming.\n \n, who has advised US President \n on space issues, has advocated that NASA should focus on space exploration and that its climate study operations should be transferred to other agencies such as \n. Former NASA atmospheric scientist \n countered that Earth science study was built into NASA's mission at \n in the 1958 \n.\n NASA won the \n in the category Web.\n\n\n. Since 2011, the ELaNa program has provided opportunities for NASA to work with university teams to test emerging technologies and commercial-off-the-shelf solutions by providing launch opportunities for developed \n using NASA procured launch opportunities.\n By example, two NASA-sponsored \n launched in June 2022 on a \n \n vehicle as the ELaNa 39 mission.\n\n\n. NASA started an annual competition in 2014 named \"Cubes in Space\".\n It is jointly organized by NASA and the global education company \n, with the objective of teaching school students aged 11–18 to design and build scientific experiments to be launched into space on a NASA rocket or balloon. On June 21, 2017, the world's smallest satellite, KalamSAT, was launched.\n\n\nUS law requires the \n to be used in all US Government programs, \"except where impractical\".\n\n\nIn 1969, \n landed on the Moon using a mix of \n and \n. In the 1980s, NASA started the transition towards the metric system, but was still using both systems in the 1990s.\n On September 23, 1999, a mixup between NASA's use of SI units and \n's use of US units resulted in the loss of the \n.\n\n\nIn August 2007, NASA stated that all future missions and explorations of the Moon would be done entirely using the SI system. This was done to improve cooperation with space agencies of other countries that already use the metric system.\n As of 2007, NASA is predominantly working with SI units, but some projects still use US units, and some, including the International Space Station, use a mix of both.\n\n\nApproaching 40 years of service, the \n channel airs content ranging from live coverage of crewed missions to video coverage of significant milestones for operating robotic spacecraft (e.g. rover landings on Mars) and domestic and international launches.\n The channel is delivered by NASA and is broadcast by satellite and over the Internet. The system initially started to capture archival footage of important space events for NASA managers and engineers and expanded as public interest grew. The \n Christmas Eve broadcast while in orbit around the Moon was received by more than a billion people.\n NASA's video transmission of the \n Moon landing was awarded a \n in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the landing.\n The channel is a product of the U.S. Government and is widely available across many television and Internet platforms.\n\n\nNASAcast is the official audio and video \n of the NASA website. Created in late 2005, the podcast service contains the latest audio and video features from the NASA web site, including \n's \n and educational materials produced by NASA. Additional NASA podcasts, such as Science@NASA, are also featured and give subscribers an in-depth look at content by subject matter.\n\n\nNASA EDGE is a \n which explores different missions, technologies and projects developed by NASA. The program was released by NASA on March 18, 2007, and, as of August 2020\n, there have been 200 vodcasts produced. It is a \n vodcast sponsored by NASA's Exploration Systems Mission Directorate and based out of the Exploration and Space Operations Directorate at \n in \n, Virginia. The NASA EDGE team takes an insider's look at current projects and technologies from NASA facilities around the United States, and it is depicted through personal interviews, on-scene broadcasts, \n, and personal interviews with top scientists and engineers at NASA.\n\n\nThe show explores the contributions NASA has made to society as well as the progress of current projects in materials and \n. NASA EDGE vodcasts can be downloaded from the NASA website and from \n.\n\nIn its first year of production, the show was downloaded over 450,000 times. As of February 2010,\n the average download rate is more than 420,000 per month, with over one million downloads in December 2009 and January 2010.\n\n\nNASA and the NASA EDGE have also developed interactive programs designed to complement the vodcast. The Lunar Electric Rover App allows users to drive a simulated \n between objectives, and it provides information about and images of the vehicle.\n The NASA EDGE Widget provides a \n for accessing NASA EDGE vodcasts, image galleries, and the program's Twitter feed, as well as a live NASA news feed.\n\n\n (APOD) is a \n provided by NASA and \n (MTU). It reads: \"Each day a different image or \n of our \n is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional \n.\"\n\nThe photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated.\n\nThese often relate to current events in astronomy and \n. The text has several hyperlinks to more pictures and websites for more information. The images are either \n photographs, images taken at non-visible \n and displayed in \n, video footage, animations, artist's conceptions, or \n that relate to space or cosmology.\n\nIn July 2023, NASA announced a new \n known as NASA+. It launched on November 8, 2023, and has live coverage of launches, documentaries and original programs. According to NASA, it will be free of ads and subscription fees.

{"title": "Croatian Democratic Union - Wikipedia", "content": " \n\n\nRecent referendums\n\nThe \n (\n: \n, \n, \n) is a \n \n,\n \n \n in \n. It is one of the \n, along with the centre-left \n (SDP). It is currently the largest party in the \n with 62 seats. The HDZ governed Croatia from 1990 before \n until 2000 and, in coalition with junior partners, from 2003 to 2011, and since 2016. The HDZ's leader, \n, is the current \n, having taken office following the \n.\n\nHDZ is a member of the \n, \n, and the \n,\n and sits in the \n in the \n.\n\nThe HDZ was founded on 17 June 1989 by Croatian dissidents led by \n. It was officially registered on 25 January 1990. The HDZ held its first convention on 24–25 February 1990, when Franjo Tuđman was elected its president. When the party was founded, the government of the \n had just introduced a multi-party system in Croatia and scheduled elections for the Croatian Parliament.\n\n\nThe HDZ began as a \n party but also included former partisans and members of the Communist establishment, such as \n and \n.\n President Tuđman and other HDZ officials traveled abroad and gathered large financial contributions from Croatian expatriates. On the eve of the \n, the ruling \n saw such tendencies within the HDZ as an opportunity to remain in power. At the beginning of democracy the communists called HDZ \"the party of dangerous intentions\". The HDZ won a majority in the Croatian Parliament, and Croatia (then part of \n) became one of the few socialist countries where Communist single party rule was replaced by anti-Communist single party rule. 30 May 1990, the day the HDZ formally took power, was celebrated as \n.\n\n\nA \n was held in 1992, and Tuđman, who would remain as undisputed party leader until his death in 1999, was elected president.\n\nThe party governed Croatia throughout the 1990s and under its leadership, Croatia became independent (1991), was internationally recognized (1992), and consolidated all of its pre-war territory (by 1998).\n During that period, the HDZ won both the \n and \n parliamentary elections.\n\n\nAs it strongly advocated Croatian independence, the HDZ was quite unpopular with the \n minority and others who preferred to see \n remain inside the \n. This was one of the factors contributing to the creation of the \n and the subsequent armed conflict in neighboring \n. The role of the HDZ in those events is matter of controversy, even in Croatia, where some tend to view HDZ policy in the early stages of the conflict as extremist and a contributing factor in the escalation of violence while others (such as \n's \n) see the HDZ as having appeased \n and the \n, therefore being responsible for Croatia's unpreparedness for defense.\n However, the policies of Tuđman and the HDZ shifted according to the circumstances.\n\n\nThe HDZ also began to lead Croatia toward \n from socialism to capitalism. Notably, HDZ governments implemented \n in the country in a manner that critics consider sub-optimal, and at times possibly illegal, due to the selective nature of the privatizations (see \n). According to the HDZ, this process proved a useful distraction from dealing with the baggage of post-World War II communist nationalizations. It was the HDZ in 1992 which enacted into law the right of \n (the vast majority of which were under state ownership) the right to finally formally register themselves as the owners of nationalized property, thus completing their version of a process of quasi-nationalization started by the communist regime after WWII, in different targeted areas for their gain. Property returned included possessions nationalized from the Catholic Church or widely known individuals such as Gavrilović, the owner of a major meat-producing factory in Petrinja, south of Zagreb.\n\nThe \n were held 3 January, weeks after Tuđman's death. The HDZ was defeated by a centre-left coalition of six opposition parties, led by \n's \n (SDP) and \n's \n (HSLS).\n The election was seen as a referendum on the HDZ with a poor economy, corruption and crony capitalism being major factors in their ouster.\n \n\nAt the subsequent \n, HDZ candidate \n who was favored to win in the weeks prior to the parliamentary elections,\n finished third and therefore failed to enter the second round of voting, won by \n.\n\n\nIn the period from 2000 and 2003, several businessmen who became tycoons under the initial HDZ rule were tried and convicted for abuses, though in general the privatization process implemented by the HDZ remained unaltered. This period proved to be a low point for the HDZ; many thought the party could not recover.\n These people included Mate Granić, who, together with \n, left to form the centre-right \n (DC).\n\nWhen the \n (ICTY) began to prosecute \n commanders, this provoked a major backlash among the Croatian public. As the opposition party, the HDZ supported this popular discontent and actively resisted the transfers of generals to the ICTY.\n This gradually changed as the HDZ and its new leader \n began to distance themselves from the more extreme rhetoric, becoming perceived as moderates. This tendency continued when the HSLS shifted rightwards, making Sanader's HDZ and HSLS appear as like-oriented parties. This process was completed in 2002 when \n, leader of the HDZ hardliners and perceived to be associated with the worst excesses of Tuđman's era, challenged Sanader for the party leadership, accusing him of betraying Tuđman's nationalist legacy. At first it looked that Sanader would lose, but with the help of \n and the tacit support of liberal sections of Croatian public opinion, he won at the party convention. Pašalić then left the HDZ to form the \n party.\n\nAt the \n, the party won 33.9% of the popular vote and 66 out of 152 seats.\n Although it failed to win a clear majority in the \n, even with the help of the allied DC and HSLS, it formed a government with the nominally left-wing \n and the \n.\n\nWith such a broad and diverse mandate, the Sanader-led government vigorously pursued policies that amounted to the implementation of the basic criteria for joining the \n, such as the return of refugees to their homes, rebuilding houses damaged in the war, improving minority rights, cooperating with the ICTY, and continuing to consolidate the Croatian economy.\n Despite this, the EU's Council of Ministers postponed Croatia's membership negotiations with the union on the grounds of its non-cooperation with the \n over the case of indicted general \n.\n\nThis setback brought an increase in \n views among the Croatian public, which also affected support for the HDZ. Since accession to the EU was a key part of Sanader's reformist course, opposition to his leadership within and outside the HDZ was on the rise. This opposition manifested itself at the 2005 local elections and the defection of Glavaš, who not only successfully challenged Sanader's authority but also managed to nominally deprive Sanader of his parliamentary majority.\n\nDespite this defeat, the \n was able to survive until the end of the legislature. The subsequent \n in late November 2007 saw the HDZ hard-pressed both by the \n-led leftist coalition and by the extreme right-wing \n and \n.\n\nDuring the electoral campaign a vigorous and sometimes ruthless reaction from the party and Sanader himself, together with some capital errors from SDP, convinced part of the far-right electorate to support the HDZ to prevent what they perceived as the heirs of the former \n party to return to power.\n The party won a majority of both seats and votes in the election, and the first session of the newly elected parliament was called for 11 January 2008. However, the SDP repeatedly refused to acknowledge defeat, claiming that they had the most votes if the \n ballot was not taken into account. The HDZ gained the support of the \"yellow–green coalition\" (HSS-HSLS) and of the HSU and \n representatives; Sanader formed a \n.\n\nAlthough that government had a larger majority than the former one, its existence remained troubled because of the worsening of the previously good economic situation and a \n of Croatian public opinion about what was felt to be an overly long HDZ rule.\n Another major drawback was the Slovenian blocking of several chapters of Croatia's EU accession terms until border disputes between the two countries had been settled.\n Although this ultimately led to an indefinite suspension of the Croatian EU accession negotiations, it did not affect the government's popularity. In this case, as would be expected, considering Croatian staunch patriotism and national \n, all parties and nearly every Croatian citizen were absolutely adamant in refusing at any cost any concessions over matters of \n.\n\n\nIn \n held in May 2009, the HDZ, against all expectations, managed to grow again, coming ahead of the SDP.\n However, HDZ support did weaken in the larger cities.\n\nOn 1 July 2009, Ivo Sanader abruptly announced his resignation from politics and appointed \n as his successor. She was confirmed as the new leader of the party on 3 July and was appointed by president Stipe Mesić as the prime minister-designate.\n Two days later the \n confirmed Kosor as the new \n, the first woman to hold the position.\n\n\nIn the same resignation speech, Sanader also appointed \n, who had formerly held the posts of \n and \n, as HDZ candidate for the incoming \n, decreasing any speculation about his own ambitions for that position.\n\nThe \"Fimi media\" was a corruption scandal which resulted from former Prime Minister \n stealing money from the state budget. \n has charged former Prime Minister Ivo Sanader, Fimi media CEO Nevenka Jurak, former treasurer of the Croatian Democratic Union Mladen Barišić, former spokesperson of the Croatian Democratic Union Ratko Maček and former chief accountant Branka Pavošević with damaging the state budget by 70 million kuna or approximately 9 million euros.\n\n\nThe HDZ was faced with bad poll ratings and a large clean-up task that was still underway when Sanader left. The officials used the 2009 convention to elect Jadranka Kosor party president by acclamation. Andrija Hebrang accepted his designation as the presidential candidate only at the end of July, after he underwent a thorough \n, to exclude any remaining trace of a previous \n.\n\nThe Kosor government remained mostly unchanged from the previous Sanader government, but the HDZ suffered some internal turmoil as ministers \n and \n left their posts after allegations of corruption. Along with several anti-corruption investigations, the party had to deal with an economic crisis. It began tackling the issue in April 2010 with a recovery program.\n\n\nIn the next presidential elections, Croatia was looking for a replacement for \n who had held the position for ten years. But Hebrang finished third, failing to reach the second stage in which SDP candidate \n overwhelmingly defeated former SDP member \n.\n\nHowever, many Croatian people were dissatisfied with the government and protested on the streets against the HDZ government, demanding that new elections be held as soon as possible. The police placed a guard on \n to prevent civilians from entering.\n\n\nFrom 26 October 2011 \n expanded its investigation about \"Slush Funds\" on the HDZ as a legal entity.\n Previously, the investigation had included only \n, treasurers \n and \n, general secretaries \n and \n and spokesman \n.\n Party president Jadranka Kosor stated that this was one of the most critical moments of the HDZ.\n The HDZ became the first political party in Croatia to be charged with corruption.\n\n\nAfter the \n, the HDZ become the opposition after 8 years in government. The HDZ won its smallest number of votes since its founding, 563,215.\n\nOn 20 May 2012, HDZ held a presidential election in which, a day later, \n become the winner\n and thus replaced Kosor as leader of the \n. Karamarko announced that he would reestablish connections between Croatia and the \n.\n\n\nKaramarko earlier announced that, after a process of the \n of the HDZ, he would return to the policies of Franjo Tuđman. He also stated that he could be \"neither for \n nor \n\", as both of them represented totalitarian systems.\n On 1 July 2013, HDZ received full member status of the \n (EPP).\n On 11 March 2014, the HDZ and \n were found guilty of corruption.\n\n\nFollowing the collapse of the \n in June 2016, Tomislav Karamarko resigned as HDZ leader. The party elected former diplomat and member of the European Parliament \n as the new president, who won on a policy platform \"devoid of extremes and populism\".\n Plenković won the \n, in which he campaigned on a pro-European and moderate agenda.\n Plenković was appointed prime minister in October.\n\n\nIn terms of ideology, the HDZ statute, as well as its President \n and Secretary \n, define the political position of the party as centre-right.\n However, there have significant shifts in HDZ's ideological and political positions, and there are both moderate and right-wing factions within the party with different interpretations of its basic positions.\n\n\nThe HDZ leaders during the 1990s described their party as \n and \n,\n although in practice they pursued \n policies.\n However, the party was at the time mostly characterized as further to the \n than in recent years. \n\nAt its beginning, the HDZ was an ethnically exclusive party that emphasized Croatian identity. Slogans such as \"God and Croats\" and \"Croats get together\" were common, which were incidentally also used by the leaders of the \n-led \n.

{"title": "Uncrewed spacecraft - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n or \n are \n without \n on board. Uncrewed spacecraft may have varying levels of autonomy from human input, such as \n, or remote guidance. They may also be \n, in which they have a pre-programmed list of operations that will be executed unless otherwise instructed. A robotic spacecraft for scientific measurements is often called a space probe or \n.\n\nMany space missions are more suited to \n rather than \n operation, due to lower cost and risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as \n or the vicinity of \n are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as \n, \n, and \n are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them. Telerobotics also allows exploration of regions that are vulnerable to contamination by Earth micro-organisms since spacecraft can be sterilized. Humans can not be sterilized in the same way as a spaceship, as they coexist with numerous micro-organisms, and these micro-organisms are also hard to contain within a spaceship or spacesuit.\n\nThe first uncrewed space mission was \n, launched October 4, 1957 to orbit the Earth. Nearly all \n, \n and \n are robotic spacecraft. Not every uncrewed spacecraft is a robotic spacecraft; for example, a reflector ball is a non-robotic uncrewed spacecraft. Space missions where other \n but no humans are on-board are called uncrewed missions.\n\nMany habitable spacecraft also have varying levels of robotic features. For example, the space stations \n and \n, and the \n module \n, were capable of remote guided station-keeping and docking maneuvers with both resupply craft and new modules. \n are increasingly used for crewed \n.\n\nThe first robotic spacecraft was launched by the \n (USSR) on 22 July 1951, a \n flight carrying \n Dezik and Tsygan.\n Four other such flights were made through the fall of 1951.\n\nThe first artificial \n, \n, was put into a 215-by-939-kilometer (116 by 507 nmi) Earth orbit by the USSR on 4 October 1957. On 3 November 1957, the USSR orbited \n. Weighing 113 kilograms (249 lb), Sputnik 2 carried the first animal into orbit, the dog \n.\n Since the satellite was not designed to detach from its \n's upper stage, the total mass in orbit was 508.3 kilograms (1,121 lb).\n\n\nIn a \n, the United States launched its first artificial satellite, \n, into a 357-by-2,543-kilometre (193 by 1,373 nmi) orbit on 31 January 1958. Explorer I was an 205-centimetre (80.75 in) long by 15.2-centimetre (6.00 in) diameter cylinder weighing 14.0 kilograms (30.8 lb), compared to Sputnik 1, a 58-centimeter (23 in) sphere which weighed 83.6 kilograms (184 lb). Explorer 1 carried sensors which confirmed the existence of the Van Allen belts, a major scientific discovery at the time, while Sputnik 1 carried no scientific sensors. On 17 March 1958, the US orbited its second satellite, \n, which was about the size of a grapefruit, and remains in a 670-by-3,850-kilometre (360 by 2,080 nmi) orbit as of 2016\n.\n\nThe first attempted lunar probe was the \n, launched on 23 September 1958. The goal of a lunar probe repeatedly failed until 4 January 1959 when \n orbited around the Moon and then the Sun.\n\nThe success of these early missions began a race between the US and the USSR to outdo each other with increasingly ambitious probes. \n was the first probe to study another planet, revealing Venus' extremely hot temperature to scientists in 1962, while the Soviet \n was the first atmospheric probe to study Venus. \n 1965 Mars flyby snapped the first images of its cratered surface, which the Soviets responded to a few months later with images from on its surface from \n. In 1967, America's \n gathered information about the Moon's surface that would prove crucial to the \n mission that landed humans on the Moon two years later.\n\n\nThe first interstellar probe was \n, launched 5 September 1977. It entered interstellar space on 25 August 2012,\n followed by its twin \n on 5 November 2018.\n\n\nNine other countries have successfully launched satellites using their own launch vehicles: France (1965),\n Japan\n and China (1970),\n the United Kingdom (1971),\n India (1980),\n Israel (1988),\n Iran (2009),\n North Korea (2012),\n and South Korea (2022).\n\n\n becomes \n when the time delay is short enough to permit control of the spacecraft in close to real time by humans. Even the two seconds light speed delay for the Moon is too far away for telepresence exploration from Earth. The L1 and L2 positions permit 400-millisecond round trip delays, which is just close enough for telepresence operation. Telepresence has also been suggested as a way to repair satellites in Earth orbit from Earth. The \n in 2012 explored this and other topics.\n\n\nIn spacecraft design, the \n considers a vehicle to consist of the mission \n and the \n (or platform). The bus provides physical structure, thermal control, electrical power, attitude control and telemetry, tracking and commanding.\n\n\n divides the \"flight system\" of a spacecraft into subsystems.\n These include:\n\nThe physical backbone structure, which\n\nThis is sometimes referred to as the command and data subsystem. It is often responsible for:\n\nThis system is mainly responsible for the correct spacecraft's orientation in space (attitude) despite external disturbance-gravity gradient effects, magnetic-field torques, solar radiation and aerodynamic drag; in addition it may be required to reposition movable parts, such as antennas and solar arrays.\n\n\nIntegrated sensing incorporates an image transformation \n to interpret the immediate imagery land data, perform a real-time detection and avoidance of terrain hazards that may impede safe landing, and increase the accuracy of landing at a desired site of interest using landmark localization techniques. Integrated sensing completes these tasks by relying on pre-recorded information and cameras to understand its location and determine its position and whether it is correct or needs to make any corrections (localization). The cameras are also used to detect any possible hazards whether it is increased fuel consumption or it is a physical hazard such as a poor landing spot in a crater or cliff side that would make landing very not ideal (hazard assessment).\n\nIn planetary exploration missions involving robotic spacecraft, there are three key parts in the processes of landing on the surface of the planet to ensure a safe and successful landing.\n This process includes an entry into the planetary gravity field and atmosphere, a descent through that atmosphere towards an intended/targeted region of scientific value, and a safe landing that guarantees the integrity of the instrumentation on the craft is preserved. While the robotic spacecraft is going through those parts, it must also be capable of estimating its position compared to the surface in order to ensure reliable control of itself and its ability to maneuver well. The robotic spacecraft must also efficiently perform hazard assessment and trajectory adjustments in real time to avoid hazards. To achieve this, the robotic spacecraft requires accurate knowledge of where the spacecraft is located relative to the surface (localization), what may pose as hazards from the terrain (hazard assessment), and where the spacecraft should presently be headed (hazard avoidance). Without the capability for operations for localization, hazard assessment, and avoidance, the robotic spacecraft becomes unsafe and can easily enter dangerous situations such as surface collisions, undesirable fuel consumption levels, and/or unsafe maneuvers.\n\nComponents in the \n subsystem include radio antennas, transmitters and receivers. These may be used to communicate with ground stations on Earth, or with other spacecraft.\n\n\nThe supply of electric power on spacecraft generally come from \n (solar) cells or from a \n. Other components of the subsystem include batteries for storing power and distribution circuitry that connects components to the power sources.\n\n\nSpacecraft are often protected from temperature fluctuations with insulation. Some spacecraft use mirrors and sunshades for additional protection from solar heating. They also often need shielding from \n and orbital debris.\n\n\nSpacecraft \n is a method that allows a \n to travel through space by generating thrust to push it forward.\n However, there is not one universally used propulsion system: monopropellant, bipropellant, ion propulsion, etc. Each propulsion system generates thrust in slightly different ways with each system having its own advantages and disadvantages. But, most spacecraft propulsion today is based on \n engines. The general idea behind rocket engines is that when an oxidizer meets the fuel source, there is explosive release of energy and heat at high speeds, which propels the spacecraft forward. This happens due to one basic principle known as \n. According to Newton, \"to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\" As the energy and heat is being released from the back of the spacecraft, gas particles are being pushed around to allow the spacecraft to propel forward. The main reason behind the usage of rocket engine today is because rockets are the most powerful form of propulsion there is.\n\nFor a propulsion system to work, there is usually an \n line and a fuel line. This way, the spacecraft propulsion is controlled. But in a monopropellant propulsion, there is no need for an oxidizer line and only requires the fuel line.\n This works due to the oxidizer being chemically bonded into the fuel molecule itself. But for the propulsion system to be controlled, the combustion of the fuel can only occur due to a presence of a \n. This is quite advantageous due to making the rocket engine lighter and cheaper, easy to control, and more reliable. But, the downfall is that the chemical is very dangerous to manufacture, store, and transport.\n\nA bipropellant propulsion system is a rocket engine that uses a liquid propellent.\n This means both the oxidizer and fuel line are in liquid states. This system is unique because it requires no ignition system, the two liquids would spontaneously combust as soon as they come into contact with each other and produces the propulsion to push the spacecraft forward. The main benefit for having this technology is because that these kinds of liquids have relatively high density, which allows the volume of the propellent tank to be small, therefore increasing space efficacy. The downside is the same as that of monopropellant propulsion system: very dangerous to manufacture, store, and transport.\n\nAn \n propulsion system is a type of engine that generates thrust by the means of electron bombardment or the acceleration of ions.\n By shooting high-energy \n to a propellant atom (neutrally charge), it removes electrons from the propellant atom and this results the propellant atom becoming a positively charged atom. The positively charged ions are guided to pass through positively charged grids that contains thousands of precise aligned holes are running at high voltages. Then, the aligned positively charged ions accelerates through a negative charged accelerator grid that further increases the speed of the ions up to 40 kilometres per second (90,000 mph). The momentum of these positively charged ions provides the thrust to propel the spacecraft forward. The advantage of having this kind of propulsion is that it is incredibly efficient in maintaining constant velocity, which is needed for deep-space travel. However, the amount of thrust produced is extremely low and that it needs a lot of electrical power to operate.\n\nMechanical components often need to be moved for deployment after launch or prior to landing. In addition to the use of motors, many one-time movements are controlled by \n devices.\n\n\nRobotic spacecraft are specifically designed system for a specific hostile environment.\n Due to their specification for a particular environment, it varies greatly in complexity and capabilities. While an uncrewed spacecraft is a spacecraft without personnel or crew and is operated by automatic (proceeds with an action without human intervention) or remote control (with human intervention). The term 'uncrewed spacecraft' does not imply that the spacecraft is robotic.\n\nRobotic spacecraft use \n to radio back to Earth acquired data and vehicle status information. Although generally referred to as \"remotely controlled\" or \"telerobotic\", the earliest orbital spacecraft – such as Sputnik 1 and Explorer 1 – did not receive control signals from Earth. Soon after these first spacecraft, command systems were developed to allow remote control from the ground. Increased \n is important for distant probes where the light travel time prevents rapid decision and control from Earth. Newer probes such as \n and the \n are highly autonomous and use on-board computers to operate independently for extended periods of time.\n\n\nA \n is a robotic spacecraft that does not orbit Earth, but instead, explores further into outer space. Space probes have different sets of scientific instruments onboard. A space probe may approach the Moon; travel through interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or enter interstellar space. Space probes send collected data to Earth. Space probes can be orbiters, landers, and rovers. Space probes can also \n and return it to Earth.\n\n\nOnce a probe has left the vicinity of Earth, its trajectory will likely take it along an \n \n similar to the Earth's orbit. To reach another planet, the simplest practical method is a \n. More complex techniques, such as \n, can be more fuel-efficient, though they may require the probe to spend more time in transit. Some high \n missions (such as those with high \n) can only be performed, within the limits of modern propulsion, using gravitational slingshots. A technique using very little propulsion, but requiring a considerable amount of time, is to follow a trajectory on the \n.\n\n\nA \n or \n is a \n in outer space used to observe astronomical objects. Space telescopes avoid the filtering and distortion of \n which they observe, and avoid \n which \n encounter. They are divided into two types: satellites which map the entire sky (\n), and satellites which focus on selected \n or parts of the sky and beyond. Space telescopes are distinct from \n, which point toward Earth for \n, applied for \n, \n, and \n.\n\n or \n are robotic spacecraft that are designed specifically to carry \n, possibly to support \n' operation by transporting food, propellant and other supplies. This is different from a space probe, whose missions are to conduct scientific investigations.\n\nAutomated cargo spacecraft have been used since 1978 and have serviced \n, \n, \n, the \n and \n space station.\n\nAs of 2024, four different cargo spacecraft are used to supply the \n: Russian \n, \n American \n,\n \n, \n and \n.\n Chinese \n is used to supply \n.\n\n\n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n\n"},
{"title": "Voyager 1 - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\nelapsed\n\n is a \n launched by \n on September 5, 1977, as part of the \n to study the outer \n and the \n beyond the Sun's \n. It was launched 16 days after its twin \n. It communicates through the \n (DSN) to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. Real-time distance and velocity data are provided by \n and \n.\n At a distance of 162.7 \n (24.3 \n \n; 15.1 billion \n) from Earth as of May 2024\n,\n it is the most distant manmade object from Earth.\n The probe made \n of \n, \n, and Saturn's largest \n, \n. NASA had a choice of either doing a \n or Titan flyby; exploration of the moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere.\n \n studied the weather, \n, and rings of the two gas giants and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons.\n\nAs part of the \n and like its sister craft \n, the spacecraft's extended mission is to locate and study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere and to begin exploring the \n. \n crossed the \n and entered \n on August 25, 2012, making it the first spacecraft to do so.\n Two years later, \n began experiencing a third wave of \n from the \n that continued to at least December 15, 2014, further confirming that the probe is in interstellar space.\n\n\nIn 2017, the Voyager team successfully fired the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first time since 1980, enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years.\n \ns extended mission is expected to continue to return science data until at least 2025, with a maximum lifespan of until 2030.\n Its \n (RTGs) may supply enough electric power to return engineering data until 2036.\n\n\nA 1960s proposal for a \n to study the outer planets led NASA to begin work on a mission during the early 1970s.\n Information gathered by the \n spacecraft helped engineers design \n to better cope with the intense radiation around Jupiter.\n Still, shortly before launch, strips of kitchen-grade \n were applied to certain cables to improve radiation shielding.\n\n\nInitially, \n was planned as \n of the \n. Due to budget cuts, the mission was reduced to a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn and renamed the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. The name was changed to \n when the probe designs began to differ substantially from Mariner missions.\n\n\n was built by the \n. It has 16 \n thrusters, \n \n, and \n to keep the probe's radio antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and eight backup thrusters.\n The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as \n as it travels through space.\n\n\nThe radio \n of \n was designed to be used up to and beyond the limits of the \n. It has a 3.7-metre (12 ft) \n \n \n to send and receive \n via the three \n stations on the Earth.\n The spacecraft normally transmits data to Earth over Deep Space Network Channel 18, using a frequency of either 2.3 GHz or 8.4 GHz, while signals from Earth to Voyager are transmitted at 2.1 GHz.\n\n\nWhen \n is unable to communicate with the Earth, its digital \n recorder (DTR) can record about 67 megabytes of data for later transmission.\n As of 2023\n, signals from \n take more than 22 hours to reach Earth.\n\n\n has three \n (RTGs) mounted on a boom. Each \n contains 24 pressed \n oxide spheres.\n The RTGs generated about 470 W of \n at the time of launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat.\n The power output of the RTGs declines over time due to the 87.7-year \n of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples, but they will continue to support some of its operations until at least 2025.\n\n\nUnlike \n other instruments, the operation of the cameras for \n is not autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the  \n, the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS). Since the 1990s, most space probes have been equipped with completely autonomous cameras.\n\n\nThe computer command subsystem (CCS) controls the cameras. The CCS contains fixed computer programs, such as command decoding, fault-detection and fault-correction routines, antenna pointing routines, and spacecraft sequencing routines. This computer is an improved version of the one that was used in the 1970s \n.\n\n\nThe Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) controls the spacecraft orientation (its \n). It keeps the \n pointing towards \n, controls attitude changes, and points the scan platform. The custom-built AACS systems on both Voyagers are the same.\n\n\nThe \n probe was launched on September 5, 1977, from \n at the \n, aboard a \n \n. The \n probe had been launched two weeks earlier, on August 20, 1977. Despite being launched later, \n reached both Jupiter\n and Saturn sooner, following a shorter trajectory.\n\n\ns launch almost failed because Titan's LR-91 second stage shut down prematurely, leaving 1,200 pounds (540 kg) of propellant unburned. Recognizing the deficiency, the Centaur stage's on-board computers ordered a burn that was far longer than planned in order to compensate. Centaur extended its own burn and was able to give \n the additional velocity it needed. At cutoff, the Centaur was only 3.4 seconds from propellant exhaustion. If the same failure had occurred during \ns launch a few weeks earlier, the Centaur would have run out of propellant before the probe reached the correct trajectory. Jupiter was in a more favorable position vis-à-vis Earth during the launch of \n than during the launch of \n.\n\n\n initial orbit had an aphelion of 8.9 AU (830 million mi), just a little short of Saturn's orbit of 9.5 AU (880 million mi). \ns initial orbit had an aphelion of 6.2 AU (580 million mi), well short of Saturn's orbit.\n\n\n began photographing \n in January 1979. Its closest approach to Jupiter was on March 5, 1979, at a distance of about 349,000 kilometres (217,000 miles) from the planet's center.\n Because of the greater photographic resolution allowed by a closer approach, most observations of the moons, rings, magnetic fields, and the \n environment of the Jovian system were made during the 48-hour period that bracketed the closest approach. Voyager 1 finished photographing the Jovian system in April 1979.\n\n\nThe discovery of ongoing volcanic activity on the moon \n was probably the greatest surprise. It was the first time active volcanoes had been seen on another body in the \n. It appears that activity on Io affects the entire \n. Io appears to be the primary source of matter that pervades the Jovian magnetosphere – the region of space that surrounds the planet influenced by the planet's strong \n. \n, \n, and \n, apparently erupted by Io's volcanoes and sputtered off the surface by the impact of high-energy particles, were detected at the outer edge of the \n.\n\n\nThe two Voyager space probes made a number of important discoveries about Jupiter, its satellites, its radiation belts, and its never-before-seen \n.\n\nThe gravitational assist trajectories at Jupiter were successfully carried out by both Voyagers, and the two spacecraft went on to visit \n and its system of moons and rings. \n encountered Saturn in November 1980, with the closest approach on November 12, 1980, when the space probe came within 124,000 kilometres (77,000 mi) of Saturn's cloud-tops. The space probe's cameras detected complex structures in the \n, and its \n instruments studied the atmospheres of Saturn and its giant moon \n.\n\n\n found that about seven percent of the volume of Saturn's upper atmosphere is \n (compared with 11 percent of Jupiter's atmosphere), while almost all the rest is \n. Since Saturn's internal helium abundance was expected to be the same as Jupiter's and the Sun's, the lower abundance of helium in the upper atmosphere may imply that the heavier helium may be slowly sinking through Saturn's hydrogen; that might explain the excess heat that Saturn radiates over energy it receives from the Sun. Winds blow at high speeds on Saturn. Near the equator, the Voyagers measured winds about 500 m/s (1,100 mph). The wind blows mostly in an easterly direction.\n\n\nThe Voyagers found \n-like \n emissions of \n at mid-latitudes in the atmosphere, and auroras at polar latitudes (above 65 degrees). The high-level auroral activity may lead to the formation of complex \n that are carried toward the \n. The mid-latitude auroras, which occur only in sunlit regions, remain a puzzle, since bombardment by electrons and ions, known to cause auroras on Earth, occurs primarily at high latitudes. Both Voyagers measured the \n (the length of a day) at 10 hours, 39 minutes, 24 seconds.\n\n\ns mission included a flyby of Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which had long been known to have an atmosphere. Images taken by \n in 1979 had indicated the atmosphere was substantial and complex, further increasing interest. The Titan flyby occurred as the spacecraft entered the system to avoid any possibility of damage closer to Saturn compromising observations, and approached to within 6,400 km (4,000 mi), passing behind Titan as seen from Earth and the Sun. Voyager's measurement of the atmosphere's effect on sunlight and Earth-based measurement of its effect on the probe's radio signal were used to determine the atmosphere's composition, density, and pressure. Titan's mass was also measured by observing its effect on the probe's trajectory. The thick haze prevented any visual observation of the surface, but the measurement of the atmosphere's composition, temperature, and pressure led to speculation that lakes of liquid hydrocarbons could exist on the surface.\n\n\nBecause observations of Titan were considered vital, the trajectory chosen for \n was designed around the optimum Titan flyby, which took it below the south pole of Saturn and out of the plane of the \n, ending its planetary science mission.\n Had \n failed or been unable to observe Titan, \n's trajectory would have been altered to incorporate the Titan flyby,\n precluding any visit to Uranus and Neptune.\n The trajectory \n was launched into would not have allowed it to continue on to Uranus and Neptune,\n but could have been altered to avoid a Titan flyby and travel from Saturn to \n, arriving in 1986.\n\n\nOn February 14, 1990, \n took the first \"\n\" of the Solar System as seen from outside,\n which includes the image of planet Earth known as \n. Soon afterward, its cameras were deactivated to conserve energy and computer resources for other equipment. The camera software has been removed from the spacecraft, so it would now be complex to get them working again. Earth-side software and computers for reading the images are also no longer available.\n\n\nOn February 17, 1998, \n reached a distance of 69 AU (6.4 billion mi; 10.3 billion km) from the Sun and overtook \n as the most distant spacecraft from Earth.\n Traveling at about 17 km/s (11 mi/s), it has the fastest heliocentric \n of any spacecraft.\n\n\nAs \n headed for interstellar space, its instruments continued to study the Solar System. Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists used the \n experiments aboard \n and \n to look for the \n, the boundary at which the \n transitions into the \n.\n As of 2013\n, the probe was moving with a relative velocity to the Sun of about 61,197 kilometres per hour (38,026 mph).\n\nWith the velocity the probe is currently maintaining, \n is traveling about 523 million km (325 million mi) per year,\n or about one \n per 18,000 years.\n\nScientists at the \n \n believe that \n entered the \n in February 2003.\n This marks the point where the solar wind slows to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt and discussed this in the journal \n of November 6, 2003.\n The issue would not be resolved until other data became available, since \n solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.\n\n\nIn May 2005, a NASA press release said that the consensus was that \n was then in the \n.\n In a scientific session at the \n meeting in \n on May 25, 2005, \n presented evidence that the craft crossed the termination shock in late 2004.\n This event is estimated to have occurred on December 15, 2004, at a distance of 94 AU (8,700 million mi) from the Sun.\n\n\nOn March 31, 2006, \n from \n in Germany tracked and received radio waves from \n using the 20-metre (66 ft) dish at \n with a long integration technique. Retrieved data was checked and verified against data from the \n station at Madrid, Spain. This seems to be the first such amateur tracking of \n.\n\n\nIt was confirmed on December 13, 2010, that \n had passed the reach of the radial outward flow of the \n, as measured by the Low Energy Charged Particle device. It is suspected that solar wind at this distance turns sideways because of interstellar wind pushing against the heliosphere. Since June 2010, detection of solar wind had been consistently at zero, providing conclusive evidence of the event.\n On this date, the spacecraft was approximately 116 AU (17.4 billion km; 10.8 billion mi) from the Sun.\n\n\n was commanded to change its orientation to measure the sideways motion of the solar wind at that location in space in March 2011 (~33yr 6mo from launch). A test roll done in February had confirmed the spacecraft's ability to maneuver and reorient itself. The course of the spacecraft was not changed. It rotated 70 degrees counterclockwise with respect to Earth to detect the solar wind. This was the first time the spacecraft had done any major maneuvering since the \n of the planets was taken in 1990. After the first roll the spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with \n, \n's guide star, and it resumed sending transmissions back to Earth. \n was expected to enter interstellar space \"at any time\". \n was still detecting outward flow of solar wind at that point but it was estimated that in the following months or years it would experience the same conditions as \n.\n\n\nThe spacecraft was reported at 12.44° declination and 17.163 hours right ascension, and at an ecliptic latitude of 34.9° (the ecliptic latitude changes very slowly), placing it in the constellation \n as observed from the Earth on May 21, 2011.\n\n\nOn December 1, 2011, it was announced that \n had detected the first \n originating from the \n galaxy. Lyman-alpha radiation had previously been detected from other galaxies, but because of interference from the Sun, the radiation from the Milky Way was not detectable.\n\n\nNASA announced on December 5, 2011, that \n had entered a new region referred to as a \"cosmic purgatory\". Within this stagnation region, charged particles streaming from the Sun slow and turn inward, and the Solar System's magnetic field is doubled in strength as interstellar space appears to be applying pressure. Energetic particles originating in the Solar System decline by nearly half, while the detection of high-energy electrons from outside increases 100-fold. The inner edge of the stagnation region is located approximately 113 AU from the Sun.\n\n\nNASA announced in June 2012 that the probe was detecting changes in the environment that were suspected to correlate with arrival at the \n.\n \n had reported a marked increase in its detection of charged particles from interstellar space, which are normally deflected by the solar winds within the \n from the Sun. The craft thus began to enter the interstellar medium at the edge of the Solar System.\n\n\n became the first spacecraft to cross the heliopause in August 2012, then at a distance of 121 AU (1.12\n10\n mi; 1.81\n10\n km) from the Sun, although this was not confirmed for another year.\n\n\nAs of September 2012, sunlight took 16.89 hours to get to \n which was at a distance of 121 AU. The \n of the Sun from the spacecraft was −16.3 (about 30 times brighter than the full Moon).\n The spacecraft was traveling at 17.043 km/s (10.590 mi/s) relative to the Sun. At this rate, it would need about 17,565 years at this speed to travel a single \n.\n To compare, \n, the closest star to the Sun, is about 4.2 \n (\n) distant. If the spacecraft was traveling in the direction of that star, it would take 73,775 years to reach it. (\n is heading in the direction of the constellation \n.\n)\n\nIn late 2012, researchers reported that particle data from the spacecraft suggested that the probe had passed through the heliopause. Measurements from the spacecraft revealed a steady rise since May in collisions with high energy particles (above 70 MeV), which are thought to be \n emanating from \n explosions far beyond the \n, with a sharp increase in these collisions in late August. At the same time, in late August, there was a dramatic drop in collisions with low-energy particles, which are thought to originate from the Sun.\n\n\nEd Roelof, space scientist at Johns Hopkins University and principal investigator for the Low-Energy Charged Particle instrument on the spacecraft, declared that \"most scientists involved with \n would agree that [these two criteria] have been sufficiently satisfied\".\n However, the last criterion for officially declaring that \n had crossed the boundary, the expected change in magnetic field direction (from that of the Sun to that of the interstellar field beyond), had not been observed (the field had changed direction by only 2 degrees\n), which suggested to some that the nature of the edge of the heliosphere had been misjudged.\n\nOn December 3, 2012, Voyager project scientist Ed Stone of the \n said, \"Voyager has discovered a new region of the heliosphere that we had not realized was there. We're still inside, apparently. But the magnetic field now is connected to the outside. So it's like a highway letting particles in and out.\"\n The magnetic field in this region was 10 times more intense than \n encountered before the termination shock. It was expected to be the last barrier before the spacecraft exited the Solar System completely and entered interstellar space.\n\n\nIn March 2013, it was announced that \n might have become the first spacecraft to enter interstellar space, having detected a marked change in the plasma environment on August 25, 2012. However, until September 12, 2013, it was still an open question as to whether the new region was interstellar space or an unknown region of the Solar System. At that time, the former alternative was officially confirmed.\n\n\nIn 2013 \n was exiting the Solar System at a speed of about 3.6 AU (330 million mi; 540 million km) per year, while \n is going slower, leaving the Solar System at 3.3 AU (310 million mi; 490 million km) per year.\n Each year, \n increases its lead over \n.\n\n reached a distance of 135 AU (12.5 billion mi; 20.2 billion km) from the Sun on May 18, 2016.\n On September 5, 2017, that had increased to about 139.64 AU (12.980 billion mi; 20.890 billion km) from the Sun, or just over 19 light-hours; at that time, \n was 115.32 AU (10.720 billion mi; 17.252 billion km) from the Sun.\n\n\nIts progress can be monitored at NASA's website (see \n).\n\n\nOn September 12, 2013, NASA officially confirmed that \n had reached the \n in August 2012 as previously observed. The generally accepted date of arrival is August 25, 2012 (approximately 10 days before the 35th anniversary of its launch), the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected.\n By this point, most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany a crossing of the heliopause;\n a new model of the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found.\n\n\nA key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of \n observed beginning on April 9, 2013,\n triggered by a \n that had occurred in March 2012\n (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within).\n Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012\n provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because \n's plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980.\n In September 2013, NASA released recordings of audio \n of these plasma waves, the first to be measured in interstellar space.\n\n\nWhile \n is commonly spoken of as having left the Solar System simultaneously with having left the heliosphere, the two are not the same. The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one-seventh the distance to the \n of \n, and it has not yet entered the \n, the source region of \n, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.\n\n\nIn October 2020, astronomers reported a significant unexpected increase in density in the \n beyond the \n as detected by the \n and \n \n. According to the researchers, this implies that \"the density gradient is a large-scale feature of the \n (very local \n) in the general direction of the \n\".\n\n\nIn May 2021, NASA reported on the continuous measurement, for the first time, of the density of material in interstellar space and, as well, the detection of interstellar sounds for the first time.\n\n\nIn May 2022, NASA reported that \n had begun transmitting \"mysterious\" and \"peculiar\" \n to the \n (DSN). It confirmed that the operational status of the craft remained unchanged, but that the issue stemmed from the Attitude Articulation and Control System (AACS). NASA's \n (JPL) published a statement on May 18, 2022, that the AACS was functional but sending invalid data.\n The problem was eventually traced to the AACS sending its telemetry through a computer that had been non-operational for years, resulting in data corruption. In August 2022, NASA transmitted a command to the AACS to utilize another computer, which resolved the problem. An investigation into what caused the initial switch is underway, though engineers have hypothesized that the AACS had executed a bad command from another onboard computer.\n\n\n began transmitting unreadable data on November 14, 2023. The problem was sourced to the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS), one of the three onboard computer systems. The FDS was not communicating properly with the telemetry modulation unit (TMU), which began transmitting a repeating sequence of ones and zeros indicating that the system was in a stuck condition. After a reboot of the FDS, communications remained unusable.\n The probe still received commands from Earth, and was sending a carrier tone indicating it was still operational. Commands sent to alter the modulation of the tone succeeded, confirming that the probe was still responsive.\n\n\nOn December 12, 2023, NASA announced that \n flight data system was unable to use its telemetry modulation unit, preventing it from transmitting scientific data.\n On March 24, 2024, NASA announced that they had made significant progress on interpreting the data being received from the spacecraft.\n Engineers reported in April 2024 that the failure was likely in a memory bank of the Flight Data Subsystem (FDS), probably from being struck by a high-energy particle or that it simply wore out due to age. The \n team began developing a workaround,\n and on April 20 communication of health and status was restored by rearranging code away from the defective FDS memory chip, three percent of which was corrupted beyond repair.\n\n\nIn December 2017, NASA successfully fired all four of \ns trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first time since 1980. The TCM thrusters were used in the place of a degraded set of jets to help keep the probe's antenna pointed towards the Earth. Use of the TCM thrusters allowed \n to continue to transmit data to NASA for two to three more years.\n\n\nDue to the diminishing electrical power available, the Voyager team has had to prioritize which instruments to keep on and which to turn off. Heaters and other spacecraft systems have been turned off one by one as part of power management. The fields and particles instruments that are the most likely to send back key data about the heliosphere and interstellar space have been prioritized to keep operating. Engineers expect the spacecraft to continue operating at least one science instrument until around 2025.\n\n\nSome \n needed to control the attitude of the spacecraft and point its high-gain antenna in the direction of Earth are out of use due to clogging problems in their \n lines. The spacecraft no longer has a backup available for its thruster system and \"everything onboard is single-string,\" according to Suzanne Dodd, Voyager project manager at \n, in an interview with \n.\n NASA has accordingly decided to modify the spacecraft's computer software in order to reduce the rate at which the hydrazine lines clog. NASA will first deploy the modified software on \n, which is less distant from Earth, before deploying it on \n.\n\n\nProvided \n does not collide with anything and is not retrieved, the \n space probe will never pass it, despite being launched from Earth at a higher speed than either Voyager spacecraft. The Voyager spacecraft benefited from multiple planetary flybys to increase its heliocentric velocities, whereas \n received only a single such boost, from its Jupiter flyby in 2007. As of 2018\n, \n is traveling at about 14 km/s (8.7 mi/s), 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) slower than \n and is still slowing down.\n\n\n is expected to reach the theorized \n in about 300 years\n and take about 30,000 years to pass through it.\n Though it is not heading towards any particular star, in about 40,000 years, it will pass within 1.6 \n (0.49 \n) of the star \n, which is at present in the \n \n and 17.1 light-years from Earth.\n That star is generally moving towards the \n at about 119 km/s (430,000 km/h; 270,000 mph).\n NASA says that \"The Voyagers are destined—perhaps eternally—to wander the Milky Way.\"\n In 300,000 years, it will pass within less than 1 light-year of the M3V star TYC 3135–52–1.\n\n\n\nBoth Voyager space probes carry a gold-plated \n, a compilation meant to showcase the diversity of life and culture on Earth in the event that either spacecraft is ever found by any extraterrestrial discoverer.\n The record, made under the direction of a team including \n and \n, includes photos of the \n and its lifeforms, a range of scientific information, spoken greetings from people such as the \n (\n) and the \n (\n) and a medley, \"Sounds of Earth\", that includes the sounds of whales, a baby crying, waves breaking on a shore, and a collection of music spanning different cultures and eras including works by \n, \n, \n and \n. Other Eastern and Western classics are included, as well as performances of indigenous and folk music from around the world. The record also contains greetings in 55 different languages.\n The project aimed to portray the richness of life on Earth and stand as a testament to human creativity and the desire to connect with the cosmos."},

{"title": "2024 Croatian parliamentary election - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\nRecent referendums\n\nParliamentary elections were held in \n on 17 April 2024 to elect the members of the 11th \n. Prior to the elections, the government consisted of a coalition of the \n and \n, with parliamentary support of five \n MPs, two MPs from the \n and \n, and one independent MP, \n.\n\nThe pre-election period was marked by speculation about the possible date of the election, potential coalitions and unification of the opposition, as well as accusations of corruption and nepotism in the government led by Prime Minister \n and his changes in ministers.\n\nPlenković's two governments were marked by many changes in ministerial positions, a total of 30 ministers. Of its initial lineup in 2016, only \n (\n), the Deputy Prime Minister \n (\n), and the Deputy Prime Minister \n (\n) remained.\n \n ministers \n (\n), \n (\n), and \n (\n) were the first to leave the \n. They were dismissed by Plenković for refusing to reject the vote of no confidence in \n (\n) requested by the opposition. Immediately afterwards, fourth The Bridge member \n (\n) resigned from the government, as did \n (\n) who was facing accusations of plagiarism which were later dismissed by the \n.\n\n\nScandals occurred in 2018, which began with the Borg affair that led to the departure of Economy Minister \n and her replacement by \n, who was incarcerated in \n in 2022 after being charged with illegally awarding 2.6 million Kuna.\n \n (\n) resigned after a disagreement with the party leadership, and his successor \n left in 2019 after being elected \n. In 2019, five ministers left the government following a series of scandals. \n (Minister of Construction and Spatial Planning) after it was found that he conducted illegal real estate brokerage while he was the mayor of \n on \n, \n (Minister of State Property) resigned after a series of real estate scandals. An indictment against \n (\n) was brought for abuse of position and authority in the \"Software affair\", and her name was also mentioned in the Vjetroelektrana affair with \n. \n (\n) was mentioned in numerous scandals and was later indicted for embezzlement with EU funds, including 2.5 million Kuna for his winery, which he received under irregular circumstances.\n \n (\n) was dismissed for unsatisfactory performance.\n\n\nMore controversies occurred in 2020, with \n (\n) leaving the government following a series of real estate scandal. \n (\n) resigned after the crash of a military training plane in which two members of the \n died near Biljana Donje near \n. He was replaced by \n, who left after committing manslaughter while driving irresponsibly.\n \n was removed as Ministry of Regional Development and EU Funds, along with \n (\n).\n \n was replaced as Minister for Demography, Family, Youth and Social Policy by \n, who himself was under investigation by \n and also resigned.\n \n was replaced as Minister of Regional Development and European Union Funds by \n as part of Plenković's personal intentions. \n, Minister of Spatial Planning, Construction and State Property, was removed due to the slow pace of reconstruction after \n and \n.\n\n\nIn 2023, it was reported that the HDZ was preparing to hold elections in April 2024, two months before the \n. From conversations with several high-ranking HDZ members, \n reported that that Andrej Plenković would collect advantages with which he will go before the voters and ask for another prime ministerial mandate in the next year, so that the elections can be held before the \n holidays in 2024.\n\n\nOn 28 February 2024, \n reported that HDZ planned to hold the General Assembly on 17 March 2024 in the \n in \n, three months before the deadline. Information subsequently began to circulate that the Parliament could be dissolved on 22 March, the last day of the 21st session of the Croatian Parliament, and the dissolution could be voted on.\n On 8 March, Plenković confirmed the dissolution of parliament on 14 March.\n\n\nOn 14 March 2014, the Parliament unanimously voted to dissolve itself, without specifying a date for the election.\n The following day, president \n announced that elections will be held on 17 April.\n For the first time, the election will be held on a Wednesday,\n while the \n was held on a Monday.\n\n\nThe first pre-election coalition was agreed by \n and \n on 8 July 2023, with an open spot for other parties ranging from the center to the right including the \n.\n Ivan Penava (DP) did not decline the possibility but instead called for Most to join a coalition with DP.\n After that DP entered a short-lived alliance with the \n on 16 December 2023.\n On 27 March 2024, DP concluded an agreement with \n, a party which emerged following the unification of \n, \n and Independent list of \n.\n On the other hand, Most and HS decided to enlarge coalition with the \n (NLM) on 22 March 2024.\n\n\nOn 28 July 2023, a coalition was agreed between two liberal regional parties, the \n and the \n, with a main goal to represent \n and \n in \n and \n electoral districts. The coalition will also contest the 2024 European Parliament elections.\n Two more liberal parties, \n and the \n announced their cooperation on 10 November 2023. The leader of the Reformists \n said that with a high level of certainty they expect a large expansion of this cooperation with parties close to them, who believe that Croatia is institutionally and as a society trapped by the HDZ, and that this should be stopped and space should be opened for a different, much more modern, more liberal Croatia.\n Finally two groups made one single alliance on 9 December 2023. Four party leaders: Davor Nađi (Focus), Dalibor Paus (IDS), Radimir Čačić (NS-R) and Darijo Vasilić (PGS) pointed out that they are running against the HDZ and that after the elections they will not participate in the government with the HDZ, although Čačić did not rule out the possibility of supporting a \n.\n On 5 March 2024, the coalition was formally constituted under the name \"For Better Croatia\".\n The coalition later collapsed after Focus decided to ally with the \n party of \n, while the Reformists still partnered with IDS and PGS in VII. and VIII constituencies and with the \n in other constutuencues.\n\n\n dissidents led by Davorko Vidović as leader of \n made an agreement with the \n on 7 October 2023, creating the \"\n\" (\n: \n) coalition.\n Ten days later \n joined coalition emphasizing this is just continued cooperation and trust.\n On 2 March 2024, the \n joined the coalition, claiming that they recognized the great potential for positive change as well as the courage and ability to gather broadly on the left and center.\n HSS left the coalition on 5 March 2024 and joined the Rivers of Justice on 22 March 2024.\n On 27 March 2024 \"Our Croatia\" announced a deal with the IDS, PGS and the \n in III, VII and VIII electoral districts.\n\n\nThe most anticipated coalition of the 2024 election was an alliance of the main opposition party \n and left wing contender \n (Možemo!). Such an idea was seen as probable because of similar policies of the parties. We can! announced on 27 June 2023 that it would run separately, leaving the possibility after the election to form a government with parties of the center to the left, including the SDP.\n On 1 March 2024, \n (We can!) announced the start of negotiations with the SDP on a \"dotted coalition\", which means a coalition in constituencies where they do not have enough support individually. In that case, the coalition would be implemented in IV., V., VII. and IX. electoral unit, while in other units the parties would go separately.\n On 22 March 2024 Možemo and SDP announced that an agreement was not reached, which means that they will go separately in all constituencies.\n\n\nOn 17 February 2024, members of the left-liberal opposition held a \n under the name \"Enough! Let's Go to the Elections!\" (\n: \n). The protest was organized by SDP, We can!, \n, IDS, HSS and \n, Focus, SD, NS-Reformists, \n, and \n. The reason for the protest was the appointment of Judge Ivan Turudić as the \n. The day before, the same parties submitted a request for the dissolution of parliament and the holding of early elections. Most and HS joined them with signatures even if they did not participate in the protests.\n The next protest was held on 23 March 2024 simultaneously in \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\n\n\nOn 5 March 2024, a large left-liberal future coalition named For a Better Croatia was announced after an inter-party meeting. The coalition will be led by the SDP with \n as prime ministerial candidate and will include Focus, NS R, PGS, IDS, Centre, HSS, Glas, RF, and SsIP\n On 6 March, IDS and PGS claimed there will be no coalition in VIII electoral district with other parties than Focus and NS-R, per previous agreements.\n On 17 March, Grbin announced that the \n would not be part of the coalition, while the \n, \n and \n left the coalition on 19 March, citing Milanović's candidacy, which is not in accordance with the law, as the reason.\n After the collapse of the coalition, the remaining parties reached an agreement on going to the elections under the \n.\n\n\nFollowing the creation of the opposition coalition, HDZ announced that it would cooperate with HSLS, HDS, HNS, and HSU in some electoral districts.\n Hours after announcing the election date on 15 March, President \n announced at a press conference that he would be the SDP's candidate for prime minister in the elections,\n during which he would run against incumbent prime minister \n in \n.\n On 18 March, the \n ruled that Milanović may not be a candidate nor could he actively participate in support of the SDP during the election campaign,\n unless he resigns from the \n. In response, Milanović described the ruling as \"done in a gangster way\".\n Ahead of the election, researchers from the \n of \n have developed an online electoral compass test in cooperation with \n, which positions the main political parties and the user, based on a set of questions, on the \n.\n\n\nThe 151 members of the \n are elected from 10 geographical and two special electoral districts:\n\n\nOn 28 October 2022, the \n issued a warning that it could declare the next elections unconstitutional unless the electoral law was changed, due to excessive differences in the number of voters for each constituency, leading to significant variations in vote weight.\n On 7 February 2023, the Constitutional Court repealed the electoral law because the difference in vote weight between different electoral districts was too large to comply with the constitutional provision that each vote must be of equal weight.\n Parliament passed a new electoral law on 20 October 2023, which came into effect on 3 November, requiring the next elections to be held with reorganized electoral districts.\n\n\nLists for the election of representatives may be proposed independently by one political party or by two or more political parties (coalition list) which are registered in the Republic of Croatia on the day the Decision to call the elections is announced, or by voters. Voters shall propose independent candidate lists on the basis of validly collected 500 signatures of residents of the Electoral District the list is running in.\n\n\nThe table below lists political parties represented in the \n prior to the election.\n\nOn 30 March 2024, the State Electoral Commission of the Republic of Croatia (DIP) made decisions on validly submitted lists in I. – XI. electoral district and validly proposed candidates in XII. electoral district. All decisions on validly submitted lists and validly proposed candidates and summary lists were published on the same day at 5:00 p.m. on the website of the DIP.\n The table below is a list of the main parties and electoral coalitions which are contesting the election.\n\nIt is required by the election law that each list running in the election contains at least 40% of both men and women, to ensure equality. For the lists that do not adhere to this rule, the State Electoral Commission (DIP) will report them to The Ombudsperson for Gender Equality and the \n (DORH) when the parties and candidates proposing those lists can expect a fine of up to 33 000 \n.\n\n\nThirty-two out of 165 lists did not respect the rule and will be reported. A number of the main parties respected the rule and have at least six women and men on all their lists, among them Focus/Republic (11 lists), MOST/HS (11), RF (10), the Rivers of Justice coalition (10) and the Our Croatia coalition (eight). On the other hand, the biggest offenders are HDZ, DP/PiP coalition and MP Karolina Vidović Krišto's party OiP. For both HDZ and OiP, the fine could be high as much as 60 000 euros all together. When asked about this, \n responded: \"There are many more women than 30, but the circumstances are such that we have a lot of candidates, we try to balance it ... .\"\n\n\nWhile We Can! holds the record for the most women holding the first place on their lists (six constituencies), HDZ and DP/PiP have none.\n\n\nThe official \n started on 30 March with the DIP publishing all of the valid lists. It will last until the end of 15 April as the \n is enforced. It starts at midnight and lasts until 7:00 pm on the election day when the polling stations close and \n are published.\n\n\nThe campaign was marked by increased \n and \n. Many politicians have, in order to appeal to young voters, joined social media platforms like \n, among the most prominent ones being Prime Minister \n and the Diaspora candidate \n. The platforms are still being used mostly for critique, negativity and \n on opponents. Mass buying of \n, specifically \n's bot farms from \n, has come to light.\n On \n, \n has introduced the first Croatian \n politician \n (Nikolina being a common name and \"nitko\" meaning \"nobody\") to fight \n and \n.\n\n\nOn 12 January 2024, President \n publicly \n HDZ minister \n as gay.\n It was the first case of outing a political opponent as part of \n without their approval in the political history of the country. The situation caused a wave of reactions, but \n did not react and a rift was created between the activists of the community.\n In April, \n released a \n list of candidates running who are members of the community. The list of 11 candidates, mostly members of \n, included three incumbent \n officials who either hadn't publicly announced their orientation before or didn't give permission to be on the list, as well as two \n candidates. Politicians like \n (SDP) and \n (Republic) condemned the list.\n\n\nDuring the campaign, Zoran Milanović voiced his plan to form a broad \"national salvation\" \n of all parties except the currently governing \n. He also urged voters to vote for anyone except HDZ.\n \n stated that they will form a government with any party which accepts their program and PM candidate \n. Unlike \n, \n strongly rejected participating in a government with the Most or DP, saying they are the only barrier to the right in government. In case of a \n in \n after the election, they are ready to provide \n to an SDP \n from Sabor, with the condition that the right does the same and doesn't enter the new cabinet.\n \n stated that We Can! and \n are unacceptable as partners for the \n, but not SDP.\n\n\nDuring a campaign rally in \n, Andrej Plenković criticized Zoran Milanović, who has espoused \n, for \"pushing Croatia and the Croatian people into the ‘\n’\". He also compared the \n to \n in the 1990s.\n The numerous \n scandals within the government have weakened the HDZ campaign. Some thirty ministers have had to leave the government in eight years because of corruption.\n The scandal involving private \n messages of former HDZ official \n with the new \n Ivan Turudić, that were one of the causes of the \n, continued during the campaign and this time involved the HDZ \n \n. In April, several previously unreleased sets of leaked messages were published by \n that apparently testify to some dubious actions and deal-making by Rimac, involving suspicions of \n, \n and \n. Butković denied remembering contacts with Rimac.\n In the messages, Rimac also criticized the former Conflict of Interest Commission presidents Nataša Novaković and \n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike in \n and \n,\n the leaders of two biggest parties, HDZ and SDP, did not attend a single \n. \n challenged \n to one, but Plenković refused to debate Grbin, as the PM candidate of \n is \n. The \n refused to debate other political opponents, saying that he doesn't have anyone to debate with. DP leader \n and PM candidates \n (Most) and \n (Možemo!) also challenged Plenković to a debate. Grbin, Grmoja and Benčić all suggested Plenković is afraid and/or called him a coward.\n To the calls to debate them, Plenković responded by saying: \"This is a political match in which Grbin capitulated before the formal campaign, Milanović violates the Constitution, and a political trifle, like Most, is not someone we would confront (in a debate).\" Plenković, Grbin and Penava all skipped the big HRT debate, while Grmoja and Benčić attended.\n\n\nThe election produced a fourth consecutive victory for the governing \n; however, the opposition parties denied it a one-party majority in the Sabor. The official results showed that HDZ's coalition won 61 seats, almost 20 seats more than the second placed \n coalition whose 42 candidates were elected.\n Despite HDZ's plurality of votes, in order to form a governing majority, they still required to rely on forming a coalition, with the most likely partners the third-placed far-right party, the \n, which won 14 seats.\n The Homeland Movement therefore has the \n position,\n although it declined to say whether they would join a left-leaning or right-leaning bloc and setting the condition that they will not enter into a coalition with \n and \n.\n\n\nAmong the other opposition parties, conservative \n along with partners \n won 11 seats, and the green-left \n who won 10, both declared after the vote they intended to start talks with potential allies aimed at putting together some form of majority administration.\n The latter party also encouraged all smaller parties regardless of political leanings to come to an agreement in order to oust HDZ from power.

This would imply the constitution of a Parliament in which, at least temporarily, the majority will be all opposition parties (Možemo!, Rivers of Justice, IDS, Fokus, Most, and DP). Such a parliamentary majority could pass several important laws, including the electoral one, as well as annul the appointment of State Attorney Ivan Turudić. After that, in the event that the parties could not agree on the formation of a joint government, new elections could be held.\n\n\nOn 21 April, elections were repeated in two polling stations.

During this attack, 1,139 Israelis and foreign nationals including 766 civilians and 373 security personnel were killed,\n while \n to the Gaza Strip with the stated goal to force Israel to release \n.\n. The attack has been described as a major Israeli intelligence failure.\n Hamas said its attack was in response to the continued \n of the \n, the \n, the expansion of \n, threats to the status of the \n and the plight of \n and prisoners.\n In response, Israel declared a state of war, \n and launched \n in modern history,\n before commencing the ground invasion on 27 October with the stated dual-objective of destroying Hamas and releasing the hostages,\n stating it would control Gaza following the war.\n In spite of the declarations made by extreme right parties government officials clearly stated that Israel does not intend to occupy Gaza for a long time.\n \n\nSince the start of the Israeli operation, more than 34,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed,\n with a majority consisting of over 14,000 children and 9,000 women.\n Over 10,000 others are missing and presumed trapped under rubble.\n Nearly all of the strip's 2.3 million population has been \n.\n Israel's tightened blockade cut off food, water and medicine, and its attacks on infrastructure have led to a \n in the Gaza Strip, including a \n and an \n, leading to accusations that Israel is using \n.\n By early 2024, Israeli forces had destroyed or damaged \n,\n \n,\n \n,\n  \n,\n \n,\n and \n.\n Israel's ground invasion started on 27 October, focusing initially on northern Gaza, \n.

On 6 May 2024, Hamas accepted the terms of a ceasefire brokered by Egypt and Qatar.\n However, Israel executed airstrikes in Rafah later the same day.\n \n\nThe war has had significant international repercussions. \n have occurred across the world, primarily pro-Palestinian ones calling for a ceasefire and an end to the Israeli occupation. Israel's actions have been denounced in the \n and much of the \n. In December 2023, \n launched proceedings at the \n \n.

By 2015, the unemployment rate had risen to 45% (compared to the pre-blockade level of 10%).\n In 2023, \n statistics for Gaza reported 81% of people living below the poverty level, and 63% being food insecure and dependent on international assistance.\n According to an analysis in \n, the Gaza blockade created hopelessness among Palestinians, which was exploited by Hamas, convincing young Palestinian men that violence was their only solution.\n \n wrote that Palestinian attempts to solve the conflict via negotiations or non-violent boycotts have been fruitless.\n\n\nHamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by a number of states and regional blocs, particularly Israel's Western allies including the \n, the \n, \n, \n and the \n.\n Other \n including China\n and Russia do not regard Hamas as a terrorist organization.\n A 2018 attempt to condemn Hamas for \"acts of terror\" at the United Nations failed to achieve the two-thirds majority requirement set in place for the vote, with 87 votes in favor, 58 votes against, 32 abstentions and 16 non-votes.\n \n\nIn February–March 2021, Fatah and Hamas reached agreement to \n, in accordance with the \n. Hamas committed to upholding international law, transferring control of Gaza to the \n and to allowing it to negotiate with Israel to establish a \n along the \n, with \n as its capital. According to Menachem Klein, Israeli Arabist and political scientist at \n, \n subsequently cancelled the elections under pressure from Israel and the United States.\n Soon after the \n exploded, the \n started planning the 7 October 2023 operation.\n\n\nHamas officials said shortly following the attack that it was a response to the Israeli occupation, \n, \n against Palestinians, \n, and \n\n\n, the head of Hamas's military wing, the \n, said in a recorded message on 7 October that it was in response to what he called the \"desecration\" of the \n, and Israel killing and wounding hundreds of Palestinians in 2023.\n He called on Palestinians and Arab Israelis to \"expel the occupiers and demolish the walls\".\n Deif also called on \"Muslims everywhere to launch an attack.\"\n He said, \"in light of the continuing crimes against our people, in light of the orgy of occupation and its denial of international laws and resolutions, and in light of American and western [\n] support, we've decided to put an end to all this, so that the enemy understands that he can no longer revel without being held to account.\"\n\n\nThe long-term goals of Hamas are disputed. Hamas has repeatedly \n, notably in its \n.\n Some commentators have argued that Hamas is antisemitic and \"genocidal\".\n In 2017, Hamas replaced its old charter with \n that removed antisemitic language and stated that its struggle was with \n, not Jews.\n The 2017 charter accepts the idea of a \n based on the \n.\n However, the new charter indicates that Hamas will accept the peace agreements only provisionally, without relinquishing a claim to the entirety of \n nor recognizing Israel.\n The attack was also seen as a resolution of internal tensions within Hamas as to whether the group's main goal is governing the Gaza Strip or fighting against Israel.\n\n\nExperts consider the disruption of Israel-Arab diplomacy and the desire to assert its presence as a significant security and political force likely motives.\n In addition, internal strife in Israeli society caused by \n encouraged Hamas to go ahead with its attack.\n\n\nOn 21 January 2024, Hamas released an 18-page English-language document reiterating its previously stated rationales and framing the attack in a wider context as a struggle against \n, describing its actions as \"a necessary step and a normal response to confront all Israeli conspiracies against the Palestinian people\".\n It said that \"maybe some faults happened\" during the attacks \"due to the rapid collapse of the Israeli security and military system, and the chaos caused along the border areas with Gaza\" and that \"[if] there was any case of targeting civilians it happened accidentally\".\n The timing of the release raised questions; sources in Gaza, including those aligned with Hamas, told \n that the document was designed to contend with criticism of the heavy price Gazans have paid for the attacks on Israel.\n\n\n has been Israel's prime minister for nearly the entire 15 year period preceding the war, with the exception of the 18 months from June 2021 to January 2023 when \n and later \n took office.\n \n\nThe Netanyahu government has been criticized for having championed a policy of empowering the Hamas government in Gaza by, for instance, granting \n, facilitating the transfer of funds to Hamas and maintaining relative calm.\n By the conclusion of Netanyahu's fifth government in 2021, the issuance of work permits to Gazans reached approximately 2,000–3,000. Later, under the Bennett-Lapid government, this number significantly increased to 10,000,\n and since Netanyahu's return to power in 2023 the number rose again to 20,000.\n These workers were accused of spying on Israel and being complicit in the October 7 attack.\n After the attack, the \n granted additional 8,000 work permits to West Bank residents, despite concerns about their vetting and potential security risks.\n\n\nIn addition to granting workers permits, millions of dollars from Qatar have been transported into Gaza, escorted by \n, Israel's intelligence agency, intended for Gaza's power plant, infrastructure projects and monthly stipends for impoverished Palestinian families, while Israeli officials were aware that Hamas might divert the funds to acquire weapons and rockets.\n\n\nThese strategies towards Hamas have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023.\n Critics, including human-rights activists and aid organizations, cautioned that such policies may have strengthened Hamas's power in Gaza while weakening \n of the \n in the \n, thus sabotaging a \n.\n This criticism has been echoed by several Israeli officials, including former prime minister \n and former head of the \n internal security service \n.\n The Palestinian Authority and \n were also critical of Netanyahu's government allowing \n to deliver suitcases of money to Hamas\n in exchange for maintaining the ceasefire.\n Netanyahu's strategy towards the Palestinian issue has been described as that of \"divide-and-conquer\".\n A \n op-ed argued after the Hamas attack that Netanyahu's policy to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset had \"blown up in our faces\".\n Netanyahu himself has criticized opinions on his responsibility for the 7 October attacks, stating \"Did people ask Franklin Roosevelt, after Pearl Harbor, that question? Did people ask George Bush after the surprise attack of November [sic] 11?\" referring to the 11 September 2001 terror attacks.\n\n\nNumerous commentators have identified the broader context of Israeli occupation as a cause of the war.\n The \n wrote that Palestinians are \"in despair over a never-ending occupation in the West Bank and suffocating blockade of Gaza\".\n Several human rights organizations, including \n,\n \n and \n have \n, although supporters of Israel dispute this characterization.\n\n\nOver the course of 2023, before the October 7 attack, 32 Israelis and two foreign nationals had been killed in Palestinian attacks, while at least 247 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli forces.\n Increases in settler attacks had displaced hundreds of Palestinians, and there were \n around the \n which sits on the \n, a contested holy site in Jerusalem.\n\n\nIn August 2023, 1,264 Palestinians were held in administrative detention in Israel, without charge or trial, the highest number in three decades.\n Israel says this tactic is necessary to contain dangerous militants.\n\n\nTensions between Israel and Hamas rose in September 2023, and the \n described the two \"on the brink of war\".\n Israel found explosives hidden in a shipment of jeans and halted all exports from Gaza.\n In response, Hamas put its forces on high alert, and conducted military exercises with other groups, including openly practicing storming Israeli settlements.\n Hamas also allowed Palestinians to resume protests at the \n.\n On 13 September, five Palestinians were killed at the border. According to the \n, the Palestinians were attempting to detonate an explosive device.\n \n reported that a Palestinian Explosives Engineering Unit was working to deactivate the device.\n On 29 September, \n, the UN, and Egypt mediated an agreement between Israel and Hamas officials in the Gaza Strip to reopen closed crossing points and deescalate tensions.\n\n\n argues that an uptick in Israeli–Palestinian violence in the West Bank in the first half of 2023 had portended war,\n and stated that Netanyahu's \"refusal to contemplate any type of peace process\" added \"fuel to the smouldering fire\" in the context of \"the relentless expansion of illegal Israeli settlements\".\n Prior to the attack, Saudi Arabia warned Israel of an \"explosion\" as a result of the continued occupation,\n Egypt had warned of a catastrophe unless there was political progress,\n and similar warnings were given by Palestinian Authority officials.\n Two months before the attacks, \n commented that Palestinians have \"no civil rights; no freedom of mobility\".\n\n\nIsraeli intelligence officials initially stated that they had no warnings or indications of the 7 October attack by Hamas, despite Israel exercising extensive monitoring over Gaza.\n Furthermore, the United States warned the Israeli government of the possibility of a surprise attack from Hamas a few days before the incident.\n Egypt said it warned Israel days before the attack, \"an explosion of the situation is coming, and very soon, and it would be big\".\n Israel denied receiving such a warning,\n but the Egyptian statement was corroborated by \n, Chairman of the \n, who said warnings were made three days before the attack.\n\n\nAccording to the \n, Israeli officials had obtained detailed attack plans more than a year prior to the actual attack. The document described operational plans and targets, including the size and location of Israeli forces, and raised questions in Israel as to how Hamas was able to learn these details. The document provided a plan that included a large scale rocket assault prior to an invasion, drones to knock out the surveillance cameras and gun turrets that Israel has deployed along the border, and gunmen invading Israel, including with \n. The \n reported that \"Hamas followed the blueprint with shocking precision\". According to the \n, the document was circulating among the Israeli military and intelligence leadership, who largely dismissed the plan as being beyond Hamas's capabilities, though it was unclear if the political leadership was informed. In July 2023, a member of the \n alerted her superiors that Hamas was conducting preparations for the assault, saying that \"I utterly refute that the scenario is imaginary\". An Israeli colonel ignored her concerns.\n According to the \n, alerts from the signals unit were ignored because they came from lower-ranking soldiers, contradicted the belief that Hamas was contained by Israel's \n, bombing, and placation via aid, and the belief that Hamas was seeking to avoid a full war.\n\n\nAt the time of the attack, Israel and Saudi Arabia were conducting \n. Saudi Arabian crown prince \n said normalization was \"for the first time real\".\n According to US President \n and Secretary of State \n, the aim of the 7 October attacks was to disrupt the normalization talks.\n According to Menachem Klein, Israeli normalization with other Middle Eastern states, including Saudi Arabia, threatened to leave the Palestinians \"isolated and weak\".\n\n\nAs of 7 February 2024, Saudi Arabia confirmed that diplomatic relations with Israel requires an independent Palestinian state on 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\n\n\nThe attack took place during the Jewish holidays of \n and \n on \n,\n and one day after the 50th anniversary of the start of the \n, which also began with a surprise attack.\n At around 6:30 a.m. \n (UTC+3) on 7 October 2023,\n Hamas announced the start of what it called \"Operation Al-Aqsa Flood\", stating it had fired over 5,000 rockets from the Gaza Strip into Israel within a span of 20 minutes. Israeli sources reported that at least 3,000 projectiles had been launched from Gaza. At least five people were killed by the rocket attacks.\n Explosions were reported in areas surrounding the strip and in cities in the \n including \n, \n,\n \n, and \n.\n Air raid sirens were activated in \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n.\n Hamas issued a call to arms, with commander Mohammad Deif calling on \"Muslims everywhere to launch an attack\" and to \"kill them [the enemy] wherever you may find them\".\n\n\nHamas employed tactics such as using aerial drones to disable Israeli observation posts, paragliders for infiltration into Israel, and motorcycles, which was unusual for Hamas.\n Palestinian militants opened fire on Israeli boats, while clashes broke out between Palestinians and the \n (IDF) along the \n.\n In the evening, Hamas launched another barrage of 150 rockets towards Israel, with explosions reported in \n, \n, \n, \n, Tel Aviv, and Rishon Lezion.\n\n\nSimultaneously, around 3,000 Hamas militants\n infiltrated Israel from Gaza using trucks, pickup trucks, motorcycles, bulldozers, speedboats, and \n.\n They took over checkpoints at \n and \n, and created openings in the border fence in five other places.\n Images and videos showed armed and masked militants, riding pickup trucks\n and opening fire in \n. Other videos display Israelis taken prisoner, a burning Israeli tank,\n and militants driving IDF vehicles.\n\n\nHamas has also stated that its attack was in response to the blockade of the Gaza Strip, the expansion of \n, rising Israeli settler violence and recent escalations at \n.\n Intelligence and security officials from multiple Western countries say that Hamas initiated the war to create a \"permanent\" state of war and to revive interest in the Palestinian cause.\n\n\nHamas militants carried out an amphibious \n.\n A military base near Nahal Oz was also taken by the militants, leaving at least two Israeli soldiers dead and six others captured. The IDF said it killed two attackers on the beach and destroyed four vessels, including two rubber boats.\n Fighting was reported at \n military base, headquarters of Israel's \n.\n It was later reported that Hamas took control of the base and took several Israeli soldiers captive,\n before the IDF regained control later in the day.\n The police station of Sderot came under Hamas control, with militants killing 30 Israelis, including policemen and civilians.\n At least six IDF bases near the Gaza border were attacked.\n\n\nMilitants killed civilians at \n,\n \n, and \n, and other \n, where they took hostages\n and set fire to homes.\n This resulted in widespread fires and smoke across the region.\n 52 civilians were killed in the \n, 108 in the \n (a loss of 10% of the \n's population) and 15 in the \n,\n in what has been described as the bloodiest day in Israel's history and the worst single-day massacre of Jews since \n.\n \n responded to those injured from the attacks, particularly in Be'eri, Sderot, and Ofakim, with 1,400 ambulances responding to thousands of emergency calls to MDA's dispatch.\n In Sderot, gunmen targeted civilians and set houses ablaze. In \n, hostages were taken during Hamas's deepest incursion.\n Hamas said it took prisoners to force Israel to release Palestinian prisoners.\n In \n, Hamas militants took up to \n.\n Videos showed hostages being led barefoot across a street in the town.\n \n and Hamas took at least 37 attendees hostage.\n\nWitnesses recounted militants on motorcycles opening fire on participants who were already fleeing due to rocket fire.\n \n reported that the video footage retrieved from the body cameras of Hamas militants displayed several victims \"in the beginning of the footage they are alive, by the end they're dead. Sometimes, in fact frequently, after their death their bodies are still being desecrated\".\n Israeli authorities screened bodycam footage of Hamas atrocities for journalists, which included an attempt to decapitate someone and a still image of a decapitated IDF soldier.\n\n\nAround 240 people were \n, mostly civilians.\n \n include children, festivalgoers, peace activists, caregivers, elderly people, and soldiers.\n\n\nAn Israeli spokesman said militants had entered Israel through at least seven locations from both land and sea,\n and invaded four small rural Israeli communities, the border city of \n, and two military bases.\n Israeli media reported that seven communities came under Hamas control, including \n, \n, \n, \n, and \n,\n and there were 21 active high-confrontation locations in southern Israel.\n\n\nHamas and the Palestinian Authority denied the massacre, stating that Israeli helicopters and fighter jets were behind the high number of casualties.\n An Israeli Police investigation stated that the first helicopters at the scene arrived hours after the massacre began, and that they were likely responsible for only a few \n.\n\n\n, an Israeli tank fired on a house known to contain around 40 Hamas fighters and 14 hostages, among them two children; only one of the hostages in the house survived.\n The families of those killed demanded an investigation.\n A \n article stated that there was an \"immense and complex quantity\" of friendly-fire incidents during the 7 October attack that \"it would not be morally sound to investigate\" given their number and the challenges soldiers were facing at the time.\n In January 2024, an investigation by Israeli newspaper \n concluded that the IDF had in practice applied the \n, ordering all combat units to stop \"at all costs\" any attempt by Hamas militants to return to Gaza, even if there were hostages with them.\n It is unclear how many hostages were killed by friendly fire as a result of the order.\n\n\nAfter the initial breach of the Gaza perimeter by Palestinian militants, it took hours for the IDF to start its counter-attack.\n\nThe first helicopters sent to support the military were launched from the north of Israel, and arrived at the Gaza Strip an hour after fighting began.\n They immediately encountered difficulty in determining which outposts and communities were occupied, and distinguishing between Palestinian militants and the soldiers and civilians on the ground.\n The helicopter crews initially sustained a high rate of fire, attacking approximately 300 targets in 4 hours. Later on the crews began to slow down the attacks and carefully select targets.\n\nAccording to \ns journalist Josh Breiner, a police source said that a police investigation indicated an IDF helicopter which had fired on Hamas militants \"apparently also hit some festival participants\" in \n.\n The Israeli police denied the Haaretz report.\n\n\nA subsequent Israeli investigation claimed that militants had been instructed not to run so that the air force would think they were Israelis.\n This deception worked for some time, but pilots began to realize the problem and ignore their restrictions. By around 9:00 am, amid the chaos and confusion, some helicopters started laying down fire without prior authorization.\n\n\nThe attack appeared to have been a complete surprise to the Israelis.\n Prime Minister Netanyahu convened an emergency gathering of security authorities, and the IDF launched Operation Swords of Iron in the Gaza Strip.\n In a televised broadcast, Netanyahu said, \"We are at war\".\n He threatened to \"turn all the places where Hamas is organized and hiding into cities of ruins\", called Gaza \"the city of evil\", and urged its residents to leave.\n Netanyahu and Defense Minister \n conducted security assessments at IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv.\n Overnight, Israel's \n voted to act to bring about the \"destruction of the military and governmental capabilities of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad\".\n The \n, which supplies 80% of the Gaza Strip's electricity, cut off power to the area.\n This reduced Gaza's power supply from 120 MW to 20 MW, provided by power plants paid for by the Palestinian Authority.\n\n\nThe IDF declared a \"state of readiness for war\",\n mobilized tens of thousands of army \n,\n and declared a state of emergency for areas within 80 kilometers (50 mi) of Gaza.\n The \n counterterrorism unit was deployed,\n along with four new divisions, augmenting 31 existing battalions.\n Reservists were reported deployed in Gaza, in the West Bank, and along borders with Lebanon and Syria.\n\n\nResidents near Gaza were asked to stay inside, while civilians in southern and central Israel were \"required to stay next to shelters\".\n The southern region of Israel was closed to civilian movement,\n and roads were closed around Gaza\n and Tel Aviv.\n While Ben Gurion Airport and \n remained operational, multiple airlines cancelled flights to and from Israel.\n \n suspended service in parts of the country and replaced some routes with temporary bus routes,\n while \n removed the ports of \n and \n from their itineraries.\n\n\nFollowing the surprise attack, the Israeli Air Force conducted airstrikes that they said targeted Hamas compounds, command centers, tunnels, and other targets.\n Israel employed its \n \n (\"The Gospel\") software with a new and superior capacity to automatically generate targets to be attacked.\n Two days after the surprise attack, Israel said that 426 Hamas targets had been hit, including destroying \n, homes of Hamas officials, a mosque, and an internet hub.\n Israel also rescued two hostages before declaring a \n for the first time since the \n.\n Defense Minister Gallant announced a \"total\" blockade of the Gaza Strip, cutting off electricity and blocking the entry of food and fuel, adding \"We are fighting human animals and we are acting accordingly\".\n This drew criticism from Human Rights Watch who described the order as \"abhorrent\" and as a \"call to commit a war crime\".\n The first aid convoy after the start of the war entered Gaza on 21 October 2023,\n while fuel entered Gaza only in November.\n\n\nThe IDF later deployed \n and \n transport aircraft to retrieve off-duty personnel from abroad.\n\n\nAs a part of a bombing run targeting Hamas command centers and weapon caches, the IDF stated that it had bombed the \n forces—a Hamas special forces unit that is thought to have led the attack on Israel.\n\n\nHuman Rights Watch accused Israel of using \n over Gaza on 10 and 11 October, stating that it violated international law.\n Israel denied the allegations.\n\n\nAlmost a week after the initial attack on Israel, on 13 October, the IDF issued an evacuation warning for communities north of the \n. All Palestinians in that region, including those in Gaza City, were given 24 hours to evacuate to the south. The Hamas Authority for Refugee Affairs responded by telling residents in northern Gaza to \"remain steadfast in your homes and stand firm in the face of this disgusting psychological war waged by the occupation\".\n\n\nThe statement by Israel faced widespread backlash; with numerous agencies, such as \n, the \n, the \n, among others, condemning the order as \"outrageous\" and \"impossible\" while calling for an immediate reversal of the order.\n\n\nAs a part of the order, the IDF announced a six-hour window from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. local time on 13 October, for refugees to flee south along specified routes within the Gaza Strip.\n An \n at 5:30 p.m. along one of the safe routes killed 70 people.\n Some sources attributed it to an IDF airstrike, while CNN said the cause was unclear. The Jerusalem Post said open-source analysts believed the explosion originated from a car on the ground, but the cause was unclear.\n The \n carried out an investigation, concluding \"analysis of the video footage rules out most explanations aside from an Israeli strike\", although it was \"difficult to conclusively prove whether these blasts came from an IDF strike, a potential Palestinian rocket misfire or even a car bomb\".\n\n\nThe IDF stated Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating south and caused traffic jams.\n Israeli officials stated this was done to use civilians as \"human shields\", which Hamas denied.\n A number of countries and international organizations condemned what they called Hamas's use of hospitals and \n.\n\n\nAccording to an unnamed Israeli official, Hamas leader \n left Gaza City using a vehicle associated with a \n mission.\n\n\nOn 17 October, Israel bombed in areas of southern Gaza.\n Ministry of Health officials in Gaza reported heavy overnight bombing killing over 70 people, including families who had evacuated from Gaza City in the north.\n One of the airstrikes killed a senior Hamas military commander \n.\n In the afternoon, an \n in the \n, killing six and injuring 12.\n\n\nLate in the evening, an \n in the parking lot of the \n in the center of Gaza City, killing hundreds. The cause of the explosion was disputed by Hamas and the IDF, and the ongoing conflict prevented independent on-site analysis.\n Palestinian statements that it was an Israeli airstrike were denied by the IDF, which stated that the explosion resulted from a failed rocket launch by \n.\n The PIJ denied any involvement.\n An independent analysis by \n indicated that the evidence pointed to a misfired Palestinian rocket as the cause, but stated that further investigation was required.\n\n\nOn 18 October, President Biden said the Pentagon had independently concluded that the explosion was not caused by Israel, but by \"the other team\", based on data from the \n.\n Over the next few days, Canadian, British, and French officials announced that their respective intelligence agencies concluded the cause to be a failed Palestinian rocket and not an Israeli airstrike.\n In its article dated 2 November, CNN stated that multiple experts said \"they believe this to be the most likely scenario – although they caution the absence of munition remnants or shrapnel from the scene made it difficult to be sure. All agreed that the available images of evidence of the damage at the site was not consistent with an Israeli airstrike.\"\n\n\nOn 27 October, the IDF launched a large-scale, multi-pronged ground incursion into parts northern Gaza. The IDF was building up a force of over 100,000 soldiers in the cities of \n, \n and \n. Clashes between Hamas and the IDF were reported near \n and \n.\n The Israeli invasion of Gaza was confirmed after Israel said its units were still in Gaza the next day.\n Hamas leader \n said the invading Israeli forces suffered heavy casualties and loss of equipment due to an ambush.\n Two days later, \n, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), described as \"deeply concerning\" reports from the Palestinian Red Crescent that the \n had received an urgent evacuation warning. He reiterated that it was \"impossible to evacuate hospitals full of patients without endangering their lives\".\n Israeli airstrikes targeted the area around the hospital, filling parts of the building with smoke and dust, prompting staff to give breathing masks to some patients.\n Around 14,000 civilians were believed to be sheltering in or near the hospital.\n Associated Press reported that Israeli airstrikes also destroyed roads leading to the Al-Shifa hospital, making it increasingly difficult to reach.\n\n\nThree days following the beginning of ground operations, a video showed an Israeli tank firing on a taxi with a white flag on its roof that had attempted to turn around.

According to Israel, a senior Hamas commander and dozens of militants in a vast underground tunnel complex were among those killed. Hamas denied the presence of a senior commander on the scene.\n According to the IDF, the destruction of the tunnels caused the collapse of the foundations of several nearby buildings, leading to their collapse.\n Eyewitnesses interviewed by CNN and \n spoke of \"apocalyptic\" scenes, with dozens of collapsed buildings, children carrying other injured children, and bodies lying in the rubble.\n The nearby Indonesian Hospital's surgical director said they had received 120 dead bodies and treated 280 wounded, the majority of them women and children.\n The attack resulted in several ambassador recalls (see \n).\n \n, the \n, wrote on the social media platform X that he was \"appalled by the high number of casualties\" from the bombing.\n According to \n at least two 2,000-pound bombs, the second largest type in Israel's arsenal, were used.\n\n\nOn 31 October, Israel \n in central Gaza, killing at least 106 civilians including 54 children in what Human Rights Watch called an \"apparent war crime.\" HRW found \"no evidence of a military target in the vicinity of the building at the time of the Israeli attack,\" and called the bombing \"unlawfully indiscriminate.\"\n\n\nOn 1 November, the first group of evacuees left Gaza for Egypt. 500 evacuees, comprising critically wounded and foreign nationals, would be evacuated over the course of several days, with 200 evacuees already waiting at the border crossing.\n On the same day, the Jabalia refugee camp was bombed for a second time; the \n expressed \"serious concerns\" that these were \"disproportionate attacks that could amount to war crimes\".\n The IDF released what it stated was an intercepted call between Hamas operatives and the head of the \n, where they discuss diverting some of the hospital's fuel supply to Hamas.\n\n\nTwo days later, the Gaza health ministry stated that \n directly in front of Al-Shifa Hospital, killing at least 15 people and injuring 60 more.\n The IDF acknowledged having launched an airstrike at \"an ambulance that was identified by forces as being used by a Hamas terrorist cell in close proximity to their position in the battle zone\", adding that a \"number of Hamas terrorist operatives were killed in the strike\".\n The IDF did not provide evidence that the ambulances were being used by Hamas combatants but said that additional information would be released.\n A Hamas official described the Israeli statement as \"baseless\".\n The Palestinian Red Crescent Society (PRCS) said one of its ambulances was struck \"by a missile fired by the Israeli forces\" about two metres from the entrance to al-Shifa hospital.\n The PRCS said another ambulance was fired on about a kilometre from the hospital.\n WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X that he was \"utterly shocked by reports of attacks on ambulances evacuating patients\", adding that patients, health workers and medical facilities must always be protected.\n\n\nOn 4 November a UNRWA spokeswoman confirmed reports that Israel had conducted \n against a UN-run school in the Jabalia refugee camp.\n According to the Gaza health ministry, the attack killed 15 and wounded dozens more.\n\n\nAbu Ubaida, the spokesperson for the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, reported that due to Israeli air strikes, the bodies of 23 missing Israeli hostages were buried under the rubble.\n\n\nFighting continued through the middle of November and on 18 November Israeli strikes killed more than 80 people in Jabalia refugee camp.\n On 22 November, Israel and Hamas reached a temporary ceasefire agreement, providing for a four-day \"pause\"\n or \"lull\"\n in hostilities, to allow for the release of 50 hostages held in Gaza.\n The deal also provided for the release of approximately 150 Palestinian women and children incarcerated by Israel.\n The agreement was approved by the Israeli cabinet in the early hours of the day; in a statement, the Israeli Prime Minister's Office stated Israel's intention to continue the war.\n\n\nFollowing the introduction of a Qatari-brokered \n on 24 November, starting at 7:00 am \n, active fighting in the Gaza Strip ceased and some of the Israeli and foreign hostages were released by Hamas in \n for the release of some of the Palestinian political prisoners held by Israel. The truce was announced for a period of four days, but was extended for a longer period.\n\nFrom 24 to 30 November, Hamas released hostages and Israel released prisoners. On 27 November, Qatar announced that an agreement between Israel and Hamas to extend the truce by two days had been reached.\n Both Israel and Hamas accused each other of violating the truce on 28 November. On 30 November, Hamas released two more hostages as the truce, which was supposed to end minutes later, was extended by another day.\n\n\nThe truce expired in the morning on 1 December, as both Israel and Hamas blamed the other side for failing to agree on an extension. According to the \n, the disagreement centered on \"how to define soldiers versus civilians and how many Palestinian prisoners Israel would release for its hostages\".\n The remaining hostages include a \n, an additional 13 women aged 18–39, and 85 men, some of whom are over the age of 70 and 80.\n A Hamas official said that after the exchange, the only remaining hostages were \"soldiers and civilian men who served in the occupation army\", and refused to exchange them until \"all our prisoners are freed and a ceasefire takes hold\".\n US National Security Advisor John Kirby said that \"Hamas agreed to allow the \n access to these hostages while the pause was in place\", which \"didn't happen and is still not happening\".\n\n\nIsrael adopted a grid system to order precise evacuations within Gaza, released a map online, and dropped leaflets with a \n. The maps were criticized for being hard to access due to the lack of electricity and internet connectivity, and for causing confusion or panic. Some evacuation instructions have been vague or contradictory,\n and Israel has struck \"safe\" areas it had told people to evacuate to.\n\n\nTwo law experts said they had not seen significant changes in previous days of how Israel waged the war, due to its warnings to civilians appearing ineffective and it being unclear if anywhere in Gaza is truly safe.\n Agnes Callamard, Secretary General of Amnesty International, said in a press release that \"US-made weapons facilitated the mass killings of extended families\". Amnesty found no evidence of military targets at the sites of the strikes, or any indication that the occupants of the homes were affiliated with Hamas, prompting the group to request that the airstrikes be investigated as possible war crimes.\n Several decomposed babies were found in the ICU of Al-Nasr Children's Hospital in northern Gaza, two weeks after its forced evacuation.\n US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin warned against replacing \"a tactical victory with a strategic defeat\" if Israel does not work towards protecting Palestinian civilians.\n The US State Department said it was too early to definitively assess whether Israel was heeding US calls to protect civilians.\n\n\nThe IDF reported that its troops had reached the centers of Khan Yunis, Jabalia, and Shejaiya reporting the most \"intense fighting\" since the ground invasion of Gaza began.\n Intensified bombing pushed Palestinian civilians further south to Rafah.\n\n\nOn 7 December, Israel \n in the Gaza Strip, with dozens more detained on 10 December.

The ICRC said it was concerned by the images and that it strongly emphasized \"the importance of treating all those detained with humanity and dignity, in accordance with international humanitarian law\".\n The \n reported that a video of the apparent surrender of weapons is unclear whether a man is \"surrendering\" weapons or just moving them as instructed, suggested the event was performed for the camera, rather than as an act of authentic surrender, and that it not known whether the individuals shown have any involvement with Hamas or the 7 October attack.\n \n reported that Israeli security officials believed that approximately 10–15% of the people shown in the video were actually affiliated with Hamas, and that despite the public statements by Israel that this was not a \"massive surrender\" by Hamas units.\n \n described the treatment of those detained on 7 December as a violation of international law.\n\n\nOn 8 and 9 December, the IDF released footage of what it said was its soldiers engaging combatants near and inside two schools in Shejaiya. According to the IDF, fighters also discovered a tunnel leading from one of the schools to a nearby mosque.\n It also released footage of armament that it stated was found on the campus of \n, along with a tunnel shaft leading to a school 1 km away.\n The IDF said that, since it designated a humanitarian zone for civilians in the Gaza Strip on 18 October, 116 rockets had been fired from there toward Israel, including 38 falling inside Gaza.\n\n\nThe Pentagon announced on 9 December that the Biden administration had authorized the sale of around 14,000 rounds of tank ammunition to Israel without congressional authorization by using emergency powers.\n On 29 December, it did so again to supply Israel with $147.5 million worth of artillery shells and related items.\n\n\nOn 15 December, the IDF released a statement announcing that they had \n by \n. According to the IDF, they \"mistakenly identified three Israeli hostages as a threat\" during operations in \n and subsequently fired at them, killing them.\n According to an IDF official on 16 December, the three hostages were shirtless and were carrying \"a stick with a white cloth on it\" when an Israeli soldier, who declared them to be \"terrorists\" after feeling \"threatened\", opened fire, killing two hostages and injuring the third, who was killed by Israeli reinforcements.\n\n\nIn an interview to the Wall Street Journal on 25 December, Netanyahu said that Israel's objectives were to \"destroy Hamas, demilitarize Gaza and deradicalize the whole of Palestinian society\".\n\n\nOn 29 December, \n filed \n at the \n, alleging that Israel's conduct amounted to genocide.\n South Africa asked the ICJ to issue provisional measures, including ordering Israel to halt its military campaign in Gaza.\n South Africa was one of five countries making a referral of the war to the ICC in November 2023.\n\n\nThe rocket attacks on Israeli cities by Hamas decreased in frequency during this period with notable attacks on the New Year's Eve and on 29 January 2024.\n\n\nOn 1 January 2024, Israeli forces withdrew from neighbourhoods in North Gaza, including Sheikh Radwan, al-Mina district and parts of Tel al-Hawa.\n On 6 January, the Israeli government said that Hamas control over the northern part of the Gaza Strip had been dismantled without providing evidence.\n On 7 January the IDF conducted a targeted missile strike on a car carrying Al Jazeera journalists Hamza Dadouh and Mustafa Thuraya. Dadouh, Thuraya, and their driver were killed.\n\n\nOn 15 January, Israeli Defense Minister \n said that the most intense fighting in the northern part of the Gaza Strip had ended, and a new phase of low intensity fighting was about to begin.\n\n\nBy 18 January, the IDF stated that Hamas had begun to rebuild its armies in the occupied parts of Northern Gaza. The IDF had previously stated these armies were stripped of military capabilities but by 18 January the fighting strength of many battalions had been significantly restored without providing any evidence.\n\n\nOn 22 January, 24 IDF soldiers died in what was the deadliest day for the IDF since the ground invasion began. Of these, 21 died in a single incident where Palestinian militants fired an RPG at a tank as well as at adjacent buildings soldiers were rigging to demolish which thus caused the buildings to collapse. The IDF soldiers brought landmines into the empty building for the demolition process. It is unclear whether the collapse of the buildings was principally due to the primary RPG explosion or the secondary landmine explosions.\n Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant and President Isaac Herzog publicly mourned the loss.\n\n\nDuring the period from February to early May 2024, Israeli preparations to invade Rafah became a dominant issue in public rhetoric made by Israeli government officials.

At the start of the \n, Israel implemented a \n, which has resulted in significant shortages of fuel, food, medication, water, and essential medical supplies.\n This siege resulted in a 90% drop in electricity availability, impacting hospital power supplies, sewage plants, and shutting down the desalination plants that provide drinking water.\n Widespread disease outbreaks have spread across Gaza.\n\n\nHeavy bombardment by Israeli airstrikes caused catastrophic damage to Gaza’s infrastructure, further deepening the crisis.\n The \n reported over 4,000 children killed in the war's first month.\n UN Secretary General \n stated Gaza had \"become a graveyard for children.\"\n\n\nOrganizations such as \n, the \n, and a joint statement by \n, the World Health Organization, the \n, \n, and \n have warned of a dire humanitarian collapse.\n On November 8, UN Human Rights chief \n described the \n as \"gates to a living nightmare.\"\n\n\nBoth Hamas and the IDF have been accused of attempted or imminent \n, and several other \n.\n Since the start of the \n on 7 October 2023, the \n has identified \"clear evidence\" of \n by both \n and the \n.\n A \n stated that there is \"clear evidence that war crimes may have been committed in the latest explosion of violence in Israel and Gaza, and all those who have violated international law and targeted civilians must be held accountable.\"\n On 27 October, a spokesperson for the \n called for an independent court to review potential war crimes committed by both sides.\n\n\nThe \n confirmed that its \n extends to the current conflict.\n\n\nThe war sparked a major \n, with many countries around the world reacting strongly to the conflict that affected the momentum of regional relations.\n At least nine countries took the drastic step of recalling their ambassadors and cutting diplomatic ties with Israel.\n\nThe conflict has also resulted in a renewed focus on a two-state solution to the ongoing conflict.\n\n\nNegotiations have focused on the possibility of a \n in the war, with \n and \n serving as mediators in negotiations between Israel and Hamas.\n The \n passed \n in March 2024, demanding an immediate ceasefire and the unconditional release of hostages for the month of \n.\n\n\nSignificant geopolitical divisions emerged. Much of the \n provided \"strong\" support to Israel militarily and diplomatically,\n including the \n,\n \n,\n and \n although the strong support is \"at odds with the attitudes of Western publics which continue to shift away from Israel\", according to Hugh Lovatt, a senior policy fellow with the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the \n. Lovatt says that during the Cold War, Israel sided with the West against the Arab countries supported by the Soviets, and Western leaders generally see Israel \"as a fellow member of the \n club\" and that this partially \"explains the continued strong Western support for Israel – which has now largely become reflexive\".\n In contrast, the \n and much of the \n denounced the actions of Israel and its allies, criticizing the \"moral authority of the West\" and alleging that it holds \n surrounding \n.\n The double standards, in their view, is condemning an illegal occupation in Ukraine while standing firmly behind Israel that has occupied Palestinian lands.\n\n\nThe United States, United Kingdom, and Germany have supplied Israel with substantial military and medical aid.\n\n\nA public opinion poll conducted on 23–28 October by the polling company iPanel in collaboration with \n found that 57.5% of \n believed the IDF was using \"too little\" firepower in Gaza, while 36.6% thought the amount of firepower was \"appropriate\", 4.2% were not sure, and only 1.8% thought the IDF was using \"too much\" firepower. In contrast, 50.5% of \n believed that the IDF was using \"too much\" firepower in Gaza.\n According to a survey by the \n, only 10% of Israeli Jews would support a pause in the war in Gaza to allow an exchange of Israeli hostages.\n A public opinion poll conducted in December 2023 by the Israel Democracy Institute found that 87% of Jewish Israelis supported the war in Gaza.\n 75% of Jewish Israelis rejected the Biden administration's calls to change the IDF's strategy to one that \"reduces the heavy bombing of densely populated areas.\"\n\n\nAccording to a survey carried out by the \n on 7–9 December on the post-war handling of Gaza, 56% of Israelis opposed the annexation of Gaza with 33% in favor. When questioned on who should administer Gaza in the immediate post-war period, 23% supported a coalition of moderate Arab states, 22% Israeli military rule, 18% an international force, 18% Israeli annexation and 11% the Palestinian Authority.\n The Direct Polls survey found that 83% of Israelis supported encouraging the voluntary emigration of residents of the Gaza Strip.\n According to a poll published by the \n, 91% of Israeli Jews and 24% of Israeli Arabs believe that the IDF is making an effort to follow international law.\n\n\nIn an \n survey of 510 Israeli citizens in early February 2024, 68% of survey respondents supported preventing all international aid from entering Gaza.\n\n\nAround 170 Palestinian citizens of Israel were arrested for posts supporting Palestinians in Gaza, which featured quoting \n verses, \"prayers for the people of Gaza, and political analysis of Israeli military operations\".\n Between 1 October and 1 November, the number of Palestinians held in administrative detention, without charge or trial, rose from 1,319 to 2,070.\n Prisoners have been subject to torture and at least four prisoners have died in Israeli custody.\n The ethics panel of the \n voted to suspend politician \n for 45 days over anti-Israel statements in interviews he made after the war broke out. Following a rally in support of Gaza in Haifa, police commissioner Kobi Shabtai threatened to send antiwar protesters to the Gaza Strip. As of 18 October 63 people have been arrested in Israel on suspicion of supporting or inciting \"terror\" since the start of the conflict, according to Israeli police.\n\n\nAmidst the escalating violence, \n initiated a blood donation drive and the \n closed schools on 7 October, transitioning to online learning from 15 October.\n Various events and performances were cancelled or postponed including the \n, a \n concert, and football matches scheduled by \n.\n The \n ordered \n to temporarily shut down the offshore \n.\n Following a significant drop in the value of the \n, the \n announced that it would sell up to $30 billion in foreign reserves in its first-ever sale of foreign exchange.\n\n\nOn 11 October, an emergency unity government was formally announced between Likud and National Unity following a joint statement from the latter party, with Benny Gantz, a former defence minister and military chief of staff, joining a war cabinet also consisting of Netanyahu as Prime Minister and Yoav Gallant as Defence Minister. The statement said the unity government would not promote any policy or laws except those related to the ongoing fighting with Hamas.\n It significantly reduces the influence of Netanyahu's previous far-right coalition partners over the conduct of the war, which was one of Gantz's demands.\n \n reported that former IDF chief of staff \n and Strategic Affairs Minister \n would join the war cabinet as observers.\n\n\nOn 29 October, Netanyahu blamed security chiefs for Hamas's attack in a post on X (formerly Twitter); this was later deleted following criticism.\n\n\nSources identified as IDF officials have spoken to the press under the condition of anonymity regarding military strategies and culture resulting in unprecedented human losses. Among the concerns are \n, such as the programs Habsora (\"the Gospel\"), Lavender, and \"Where's Daddy?\" that identify and track targets potentially linked to Hamas with minimal human oversight. Policy changes include expanding the threshold of acceptable civilian casualties and deliberately hitting targets in their homes, often killing entire family lines.\n A senior IDF official expressed concern about soldiers \"shooting first and asking questions later,\" particularly in the cases of IDF killing of Israeli hostages and the \n.\n\n\nReactions in Gaza ranged from anger at the international community's response to fear.\n The territory faced numerous major crises. The Israeli blockade caused significant difficulties, including a lack of food, medicine, and water.\n A pediatrics doctor at Kamal Edwan Hospital described the situation in Gaza as \"really dangerous\",\n stating that, as a result of Israel's denial of clean water, babies in his ward were experiencing vomiting, diarrhea, and fever.\n Schools in the Gaza Strip were closed until further notice.\n Yahya al-Sarraj, the mayor of \n, commented that the Israeli siege was a violation of international law and urged the international community to \"support the victims\".\n\n\nInitially, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas asserted the Palestinians' right to self-defense against the \"terror of settlers and occupation troops\"\n and condemned the orders by Israel for residents to evacuate north Gaza, labeling it a \"second Nakba\".\n Later, Abbas rejected the killing of civilians on both sides, and said that the Palestinian Liberation Organization was the sole representative of the Palestinians.\n\n\nFollowing the attack, celebrations occurred in \n.\n \n reported \"Hamas called on \"resistance fighters in the West Bank\" to join the battle.\n Neighborhood watches were established in 50 locations amid fears of reprisals by \n, while a general strike was called for 8 October.\n Seven Palestinians were killed in clashes with Israeli forces on 7 October,\n while 126 others were injured.\n As of 19 October, Al Jazeera reported that 76 Palestinians were killed in the West Bank and Jerusalem, eight of them by armed Israeli settlers;\n the Palestinian Health Ministry said that 61 people have been killed and 1,250 injured in the West Bank.\n The Palestinian Prisoners Club said that 850 Palestinians, including lawmakers, prominent figures, journalists, and former detainees have been arrested by Israeli authorities since the start of the war.\n\n\nIn contrast to previous Palestinian–Israeli wars, many Arab governments such as Egypt and Jordan had strongly negative views on Hamas,\n they restrained their official reactions to neutral press statements. Public reaction in the Arab world was much more positive towards Hamas, being strongly influenced by Hamas-produced social media videos that were viewed millions of times.\n The Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion, originally blamed on an Israeli airstrike, further damaged diplomatic relations between Israel and Arab states keen to avoid antagonizing their public.\n\n\nWhereas \n, owned by the government of Qatar, gave airtime to Hamas officials, news channels in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, such as \n and \n, interviewed mainly Arabic-speaking Jews. News anchors in these countries did not refer to the IDF as an \"occupation army\", and referred to Palestinian casualties as \"victims\" rather than \"martyrs\";\n however, as the war progressed, these channels increasingly adopted an anti-Israel and pro-Hamas stance.\n Many in Lebanon, Syria, and Egypt also fear that they may unwillingly be drawn into the conflict through the actions of Hezbollah and Iran. In Egypt, populist pro-government talk show hosts opined against Hamas, asking why Egyptians should suffer to help Palestinians.\n Egypt, despite having been pressed by the United States, refused to accept refugees from Gaza.\n\n\nA \n in Riyadh on 11 November 2023 called for the International Criminal Court to investigate \"war crimes and crimes against humanity that Israel is committing\" in the Palestinian territories and for an immediate end to the fighting in Gaza.\n The summit was attended by dozens of leaders including Iranian President \n, Turkish President \n, Qatar's Emir \n and Syrian President \n, who had been welcomed back into the Arab League earlier in 2023.\n \n expressed \"condemnation and categorical rejection of this barbaric war against our brothers in Palestine\".\n\n\nMany across the Middle East, particularly among the younger population, have been \n US brands for perceived complicity in the destruction in Gaza since the start of the war.\n\n\nHezbollah denied knowledge of the attacks and warned the United States not to invade Lebanon, saying that they were prepared to face the US military.\n In a speech on 3 November, Hezbollah leader \n said Americans had threatened to bomb Iran,\n and emphasized that Hezbollah had entered the war the day after Hamas's attack and that it would not stop its ongoing skirmishes with Israel.\n He stated that the United States was fully responsible for the current war against Gaza and its people and that Israel was merely the \"instrument of execution\". He also said that anyone who wants to prevent a regional war must immediately stop the aggression against Gaza.\n\n\nIran has praised the attack while being cautious to distance itself from its planning and execution.\n Hamas spokesman \n told the BBC that Hamas had direct backing for the attack from Iran;\n European, Iranian and Syrian officers corroborated Iran's involvement,\n while senior Hamas official Mahmoud Mirdawi said the group planned the attacks on its own.\n The Israeli army and the United States say that there is no evidence that Iran is connected with the attack by Hamas.\n American intelligence appeared to show that Hamas's attack on Israel caught Iranian authorities by surprise.\n\n\nAccording to a report by \n, since the start of the war between Israel and the Gaza militias, Iran has tried to show a face of disinterest in the spillover of the conflict, and on the other hand, it has pursued an active diplomatic campaign to isolate Israel. Supporting the cause of Palestine has been one of the ideological principles of Iran's \n theocracy after the \n,\n with Ayatollah \n, the first supreme leader of Iran, announcing the last Friday of every Ramadan as \"\n\"\n and inviting all the Muslims of the world to express solidarity with the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Muslim people.\n\n\nThe Iranian government opened an account for people to deliver charitable aid.\n It also opened a website and reported that more than six million volunteered to fight.\n Supreme Leader Ayatollah \n threatened that Islamic resistance was going to become unstoppable should the war continue.\n His spokesperson later said that the \n would have delayed it but Israel would have collapsed within five years.\n\nKhamenei pointed to foreign visits to Israel and said that the fall of Israel was imminent.\n\n\nOn 1 November, the Iranian government criminalized expressions of support for Israel and making contact with its people.\n That same day, Khamenei called on Muslim states to impose a food and fuel blockade on Israel.\n\n\nKhamenei however conveyed to Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh that Iran would not directly intervene in the conflict with Israel, citing lack of prior warning about the 7 October attack. Despite this, Iran pledged to continue providing political and moral support to Hamas, urging restraint against calls for direct involvement by Iran and its ally Hezbollah.\n The IRGC's \n promised it would continue supporting Hamas,\n while the IRGC's commander General \n said that the war would bring about a political and economic decline of the US.\n\n\nPolling has indicated a divide between government policy on the Israel-Hamas war and the views of the general public.\n  A March 2024 Gallup poll found that a strong majority of Americans disapproved of Israeli conduct during the war.\n It found that 36% approved \"of the military action Israel has taken in Gaza\" while 55% disapproved.\n A November 2023 poll had 68% of Americans agreeing with a statement that \"Israel should call a ceasefire and try to negotiate\". 43% opposed \n and 39% said that the U.S. should be a neutral mediator.\n A February 2024 \n poll found that 44% saw Israel as \"a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with, but doesn't share its interests and values\", while 35% saw Israel \"as an ally that shares U.S. interests and values\". 50% of Americans believed Israel had \"gone too far\" in its response, 31% thought Israel had \"been about right\" and 15% thought Israel had \"not gone far enough\".\n Young Americans have been significantly less supportive of Israel than older generations.\n On 25 February 2024, Aaron Bushnell, a 25-year-old serviceman of the United States Air Force, \n outside the front gate of the \n in protest of the ongoing military support of the war.\n\n\nHours after Hamas's attack, US President Biden promised \"rock-solid and unwavering\" support to Israel and called Hamas's attack \"unadulterated evil\", comparing the group to \n.\n Biden said the attack on Israel was intended in part to scuttle an Israel-Saudi Arabia normalization agreement.\n To replenish Israel's stockpiles, the US said it would send \n missiles, small bombs, and \n conversion kits, in addition to fulfilling previous contracts to deliver \n fighter jets, \n helicopters, and \n air refueling tankers.\n Biden also called on Congress to pass $14.3 billion in emergency military aid to Israel.\n Details of weapons sent to Israel, which have been arriving daily, have been kept secret. Leaked details have shown that the US has sent laser-guided missiles, 155mm shells, new army vehicles, among others, at Israel's request.\n Early in the war, the \n said it would impose no limits on Israel's use of American weapons.\n\n\nA \n \n, including the aircraft carriers \n and \n, deployed to the \n after the Hamas attack,\n reportedly to deter other actors from entering the conflict.\n In mid-October, 2,000 US troops were also prepared for possible deployment to Israel.\n US officials said the Biden administration advised Israel to delay its October ground invasion of the Gaza Strip to allow more time for hostage negotiations.\n \n\n reported on a \"groundswell of opposition\" among US diplomats and national security officials, against what they saw as Biden's \"blank check\" for the Israeli counterattack.\n In early November, \"more than 630 employees\" of the \n signed a letter calling for an \"immediate ceasefire\".\n\n\nThe House of Representatives on 5 December passed a resolution that included language that said the House \"clearly and firmly states that anti-Zionism is antisemitism\" and which condemned the slogan \"\n\".\n\n\nAs the war went on, the US government became more critical of Israel, and their relations became strained.\n US Vice-President \n said on 2 December that \"too many innocent Palestinians have been killed\" and that \"international humanitarian law must be respected\". She said that at the end of the conflict, there must be \"No forcible displacement, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, no reduction in territory, and no use of Gaza as a platform for terrorism\".\n Ten days later, US President Biden warned that Israel was losing international support because of its \"indiscriminate bombing\" of Gaza.\n Biden criticized Israel's war cabinet and called on Netanyahu to replace it.\n \n\nIn February 2024, Biden called Israel's actions in Gaza \"over the top\",\n and issued a \n requiring written assurances from Israel (and other countries) that it was using US-supplied weapons in line with international law.\n\n\nOn 4 March, US Vice-President Harris called for \"an immediate ceasefire\" because of \"the immense scale of suffering in Gaza\". She said Israel must let more aid into Gaza and was imposing \"unnecessary restrictions\".\n In a speech on 14 March, the US \n, \n, berated Israeli PM Netanyahu as an \"obstacle to peace\". He said that Netanyahu \"has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza\" and that \"Israel cannot survive if it becomes a pariah\".\n Schumer called for \n.\n President Biden praised the speech and said Schumer's \"serious concerns\" are shared by many Americans.\n\n\nMounting criticism of Israel's actions has not led to a change in US policy regarding the sale of weapons to Israel. As of March 2024, Washington has approved more than 100 military sales to Israel. The Biden administration has bypassed congressional and public scrutiny by separating arms transfers into sales below the dollar amount where an official public notification is required.\n On 29 March the Washington Post reported that the US approved billions of dollars in additional weapons transfers.\n\nOn 2 April 2024, it was reported the \n put pressure on \n to approve the large-scale sale of \n to Israel in a deal worth 18 billion dollars.\n\n\nA surge in pro-Palestinian \n \n began on April 17.\n On 23 April, former House speaker \n called on Israeli Prime Minister \n to resign.\n\n\nOn 25 October, UN Secretary-General António Guterres called for a ceasefire, during a speech in which he stated that the attacks by Hamas \"did not happen in a vacuum\" and needed to be understood in the context of 56 years of Israel's \"suffocating occupation\" of Palestinians, further stating, \"the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas. And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.\"\n Israel responded by saying it would ban UN representatives from Israel to \"teach them a lesson\", and called for the Secretary-General's resignation.\n The Secretary-General rejected the Israeli accusations.\n\n\nOn 27 October, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution ES-10/21 calling for an immediate and sustained humanitarian truce and cessation of hostilities and condemned \"all acts of violence against Palestinian and Israeli civilians, including all acts of terror and \n\", adopted by a vote of 121 states to 14, with 44 abstentions.\n\n\nIn remarks to the Security Council, UN Secretary-General Guterres expressed deep concern at \"clear violations of \n\" in Gaza and also said, \"It is important to also recognise the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum. The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation\", leading the Israeli ambassador \n to call for Guterres's resignation.\n Following this, Guterres said that he was \"shocked by the misrepresentations\" of his statement, pointing out he had also said \"... the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas\".\n\n\nOn 12 December, the UN General Assembly voted to demand \"immediate humanitarian ceasefire\". The \n passed overwhelmingly with 153 votes for, 23 neutral and 10 against.\n\n\nOn 26 March, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution demanding a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the release of hostages. Under Chapter V, Article 25, of the UN Charter, the resolution is binding, however, UN spokesperson Farhan Haq stated that \"Ultimately, implementation is a question of international will.\"\n\n\nOn 5 April, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres criticized Israel for the high number of aid workers killed in the conflict.\n\n\nInternational leaders from Argentina,\n India,\n Philippines,\n the United States, and European countries condemned the attacks by Hamas. They expressed solidarity with Israel, affirmed Israel's right to defend itself from armed attacks, and described Hamas's tactics as terrorism.\n South Korea condemned Hamas and called the attack \"indiscriminate\", expressing worries that despite missile interceptor defense systems it would remain vulnerable if \n attempted a similar attack on South Korea.\n Most Latin American governments condemned Hamas's attacks in Israel, while some, such as Colombia, also expressed solidarity with Palestinians.\n The European Union announced it would review aid to Palestinian authorities to ensure the aid was not funding terrorism, and subsequently announced that immediate humanitarian aid to Gaza would be tripled.\n\n\nAustria, Germany, and Sweden suspended development aid to Palestine in response to Hamas's attack and said that they would review other projects and aid given.\n Germany sent two \n drones to Israel.\n On 8 November 2023, the German \n announced that the German government had authorized a tenfold increase in arms exports to Israel; the export of military equipment to Israel would be treated and approved as a priority. Exports worth around 32 million euros in all of 2022 rose to almost 303 million euros in 2023, most of which was authorized after the start of the war.\n Heads of the \n and the \n condemned Hamas while \n minister \n declared support for Israel.\n Croatia's president \n publicly stated that Israel had lost his sympathy due to its humanitarian crimes and \"reprisal actions\" in Gaza.\n Colombian president Gustavo Petro likened IDF attacks against Palestinians to Nazis and asked the Israeli ambassador to \"apologize and leave the country\".\n Spain's deputy prime minister \n called on the international community to put pressure on Israel to stop what she called a massacre in Gaza.\n On multiple occasions, \n referred to Israel's actions in Gaza as \"terror\" and \"terrorism\".\n\n\nResponses from African governments varied, showing division about the source of the conflict and who was to blame. However, most expressed grief and deep concerns about the outbreak of violence, with condemnations of attacks against civilians and calls for restraint and de-escalation to prevent further loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives.\n\n\nAs many as 20,000 Thai workers (around half of Israel's migrant workforce) live all over Israel, including areas close to Gaza.\n \n said their stance towards \"the deadly Hamas-led attack against Israel is one of neutrality, and the Kingdom promotes a solution that would allow Palestine and Israel to coexist\".\n\n\n said leaders of Western countries had double standards and were \"complicit\" in civilian suffering in Gaza.\n\n\nA summit in \n hosted by \n that was also to be attended by leaders of the Palestinian Authority, US and Egypt was cancelled by Jordan on 18 October, in response to the \n.\n On the same day, China said Palestinians had been forced to move south because of Israel's evacuation order \"only to suffer from air strikes in the south as well\" and called the hospital explosion a \"heinous attack\"\n while Russia labeled the explosion as a war crime, saying that the US was ultimately responsible.\n\n\nOn 31 October, Bolivia severed diplomatic relations with Israel due to what the deputy foreign minister called \"the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive\".\n Several other countries followed suit in severing relations with Israel.\n South Africa, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Comoros and Djibouti submitted a referral to the International Criminal Court asking for an investigation into possible war crimes by Israel in the Palestinian territories.\n\n\nBrazil announced a rescue operation of nationals using an air force transport aircraft.\n \n announced that it would deploy two C-130 transport planes to evacuate 200 of its nationals from Ben-Gurion airport.\n Hungary evacuated 215 of its nationals from Israel using two aircraft on 9 October, while Romania evacuated 245 of its citizens, including two pilgrimage groups, on two \n planes and two private aircraft on the same day.\n Australia also announced repatriation flights.\n 300 Nigerian pilgrims in Israel fled to Jordan before being airlifted home.\n\n\nOn 12 October, the United Kingdom arranged flights for its citizens in Israel; the first plane departed Ben Gurion Airport that day. The government had said before that it would not be evacuating its nationals due to available commercial flights. However, most commercial flights were suspended.\n Nepal arranged a flight to evacuate at least 254 of its citizens who were studying in Israel.\n India launched \n to evacuate its citizens from Israel.\n Ukraine has facilitated the evacuation of around 450 of its citizens from Israel as of 18 October, with additional evacuation flights in the planning for the near future.\n\n\nAccording to \n and Alexander Palmer, the attack showcased the decline of the \n (PLO) and the rise of Hamas as a power center in \n. They predicted the PLO's further decline if the \n held.\n Laith Alajlouni wrote that the immediate effect of the Hamas offensive was to unite Hamas and PLO. However, it may soon lead to conflict between them, possibly leading the PLO to lose control of the security situation in the West Bank, if more militant groups there begin to launch their independent attacks.\n\n\nPolitical journalist \n described the attack as \"an intelligence failure for the ages\" on the part of the Israeli government.\n The \n deemed it a \"\n\".\n A BBC report on the intelligence failure commented that \"it must have taken extraordinary levels of operational security by Hamas\".\n US officials expressed shock at how Israeli intelligence appeared to be unaware of any preparations by Hamas.\n Israeli officials later anonymously reported to \n that the IDF and Shin Bet had detected abnormal movements by Hamas the day before the attack, but decided to wait for additional intelligence before raising the military's alert level. They also did not inform political leaders of the intelligence reports.\n\n\n, chief political commentator for Israel's \n, said that the conflict would test Benjamin Netanyahu's survival as \n, noting that \n had toppled the governments of several of his predecessors such as that of \n following the 1973 Yom Kippur War, \n following the \n, and \n following the \n.\n Prior to the formation of an emergency unity government on 11 October, \n described the then-potential move as Netanyahu's opportunity to correct his course and save his political legacy.\n Citing the Israeli intelligence failure, which some observers attributed to \n focusing more on internal dissent, the \n, and efforts to deepen Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories,\n some commentators criticized Netanyahu for putting aside the PLO and propping up Hamas,\n and described him as a liability.\n\n\nIn an analysis by \n, the newspaper wrote, \"Hamas has violently shifted the world's eyes back to the Palestinians and dealt a severe blow to the momentum for securing a landmark US-brokered deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia.\"\n Andreas Kluth wrote in his \n column that Hamas \"torched Biden's deal to remake the Middle East\", arguing that the deal that was being discussed between Saudi Arabia, Israel, and the United States would have left Palestinians in the cold, so the group decided to \"blow the whole thing up\". He added that viewed from Gaza, things were only going to get worse, considering that Netanyahu's coalition partners opposed a two-state solution for the conflict. He suggested they would prefer to annex the entirety of the West Bank, even at the expense of turning Israel into an apartheid state.\n\n\nOn 9 November, the Bank of Israel reported that the drop in labor supply caused by the war was costing the Israeli economy $600 million a week, or 6% of weekly GDP. The bank also stated that the estimate does not reflect total damage and did not include damages caused by the absence of Palestinian and foreign workers.\n In the final quarter of 2023, the Israeli economy shrank by 5.2% quarter-to-quarter due to labour shortages in construction and from the mobilization of 300,000 reservists.\n While Israel did still see economic growth of 2%, this was down from 6.5% growth in the year before the war. Further consequences of the war were that consumer spending declined by 27%, imports declined by 42% and exports were reported to decline by 18%.\n\nIsrael's high-tech factories reported on 25 December that they had been having trouble with electronic imports from China due to recent bureaucratic obstacles, leading to higher import costs and delayed delivery times.\n Israeli officials also reported that China had refused to send workers to their country during the war against the backdrop of a worker shortage in Israel's construction and farming sectors.\n China's actions were described as a de facto \n.\n\n\nThe Water Transport Workers Federation of India, a trade union representing 11 major Indian ports and 3,500 workers, said it would refuse to operate shipments carrying weapons to Israel.\n The declaration came a few months after one Indian company halted production of Israeli police uniforms due to the war in Gaza.\n\n\nAbout 9,855 Thai workers in the agricultural sector, 4,331 workers in the construction sector and 2,997 in the nursing sector left Israel following al-Aqsa Flood. In addition, the prevention of 85,000 Palestinian workers from entering Israel created a shortage of about 100,000 foreign and Palestinian workers.\n\n\nOver 750 journalists signed an open letter condemning \"Israel's killing of reporters in Gaza and criticizing Western media's coverage of the war\". The letter said newsrooms are \"accountable for dehumanizing rhetoric that has served to justify ethnic cleansing of Palestinians\". Signers of the letter were criticized for potentially impeding their organizations' ability to gather news and could face management backlash,\n \n reported that \n journalists who signed the letter were barred from covering the Gaza war \"in any way\" for at least three months.\n\n\nOn 13 November eleven international news organizations sent a letter to Israel and Egypt, asking for access to the Gaza Strip to cover the war.\n\n\n reported on 14 December a statement of the \n noting that \"the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the \n, which lasted two decades\".\n More than 50 Palestinian journalists lost their lives.\n Various dangerous facts such as airstrikes, but also starvation due to lack of food, risks linking for having no clean water available and shelter made that \"Palestine is one of the most dangerous places for a journalist to do their job\".\n \n filed a complaint with the \n, under section 8.2.b of the \n accusing Israel of committing war crimes against 8 journalists.\n It also lodged a complaint against Hamas, under section 8.2.a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the 7 October attack.\n\n\nThe \n has accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families, saying that in at least two cases, \"journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed\".\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the initial Hamas assault, witnesses from the IDF and the Israeli organization \n reported on various media outlets that they had seen bodies of beheaded infants and children at the site of the \n.\n This claim was repeated by the US President Biden and by Secretary of State Blinken with the White House subsequently saying that the President was referring to the reports of beheadings.\n\n\nHowever, these stories were later found to be untrue or unverified.\n In reality, only two babies were known to have died on 7 October, one from a bullet and the other due to complications after birth.\n\n\nForeign media such as CNN, ABC, NBC, \n, and Fox News, have limited access to Gaza only in the presence of Israeli soldiers. \n reported that the news organizations \"have to submit all materials and footage to the IDF for review before publication\".\n\n\nOn 20 December, \n issued a 51-page report documenting \n's pattern of removal and suppression of speech on \n and \n including peaceful expression in support of Palestine and public debate about Palestinian human rights.\n\n\nOn 5 May 2024, the Israeli government shut down \n in Israel and authorized seizing its equipment.\n\n\nPer Israel:\n\nPer US intelligence:\n"},

In October 2023, the Tatmadaw began facing manpower issues, with desertions and low morale being extremely common. This coincided with a \n by the \n and \n in the west of the country, which was successful in taking 80 bases, 220 junta positions and several towns by 28 November 2023.\n\n\nOctober and November 2023 saw a series of concurrent rebel offensives, including \n besieging the state capital of \n and renewed conflict by anti-junta forces in northern \n and \n states.\n In Operation 1027, anti-junta forces seized \n, the capital of \n, in early January 2024.\n Operation 1027 continued past a ceasefire in northern Shan State with \n, among others, falling to \n forces in February 2024.\n As of February 2024, thousands of the junta's soldiers have surrendered without a fight, including six generals of the Tatmadaw.\n The junta used \n against the population, including \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, and a massive \n campaign that has displaced nearly three million people.\n The \n has dropped more bombs per capita than have been dropped in the \n.\n A group of observers write that the Tatmadaw's forces remain \"formidable and well-equipped\", with \"external allies and economic resources\".\n\n\nIn late March 2024, anti-junta forces in southeastern Myanmar captured \n and \n.\n  bringing the number of \n-level towns captured by anti-junta forces up to six.\n\n have been ongoing in Myanmar since 1948 and have largely been ethnic-based. \n and the \n were the primary opposition actors to the central government.\n Over the 20th century, several prominent \n (EAOs) rose and fell in influence and control. Larger rebel factions such as the \n (KIA) formed in response to \n's \n and its increased political repression.\n The \n, in response to the totalitarian rule of Ne Win, resulted in some of the first modern \n militias forming from protestors heading to areas under ethnic rebel control.\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the 8888 Uprising, the \n (SLORC), later known as the State Peace and Development Council, formed a military junta. Myanmar's military, known better as the \n, severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds through the 1990s.\n By the time of the \n, the junta had regained control of many long-time rebel strongholds including \n and \n.\n\n\nThe \n created \n with increased autonomy as part of its reforms. In 2015, the \n (NCA) was signed between eight EAOs and the central government.\n However, by 2018 the NCA began to fall apart, due to alleged violations of the agreement by Tatmadaw soldiers entering EAO territories to build roads.\n Many non-signatories continued the conflict. In late 2016, four non-signatories of the NCA formed the \n, including the KIA and \n, engaged in war with the central government and other EAOs.\n\n\nOn the morning of 1 February 2021, the \n successfully deposed the elected Myanmar government in a coup, forming a \n. Former president \n, \n, and several other members of the \n were detained during early morning raids and \n was placed as the \n and \n ruler of the nation.\n\n\nThe established motives behind the coup are unclear. In the leadup to the coup, the Tatmadaw claimed that the \n had 8.6 million voter irregularities, but presented no evidence. The coup may have been a way to re-establish the military's \n which ended ten years prior.\n\n\nThe bloody repression of anti-coup demonstrations led to the creation of armed groups to fight the \n and the military junta. Gathered under the name of the \n (PDF) and the orders of the \n (NUG), formed by parliamentarians in office before the coup d'état, the PDF and the NUG officially declared a \"defensive war\" against the military regime in September 2021.\n The \n estimated that as of 29 July 2022, around 23,521 people in total had been killed in the violence following the 2021 coup.\n\n\nIn the months following the coup, the opposition began to coalesce around the \n, which launched an offensive against the \n (SAC) and the \n. By 2022, the opposition controlled substantial, though sparsely populated, territory.\n In many villages and towns, the junta's attacks drove out tens of thousands of people. On the second anniversary of the coup, in February 2023, the chairman of the SAC, \n, admitted to losing stable control over \"more than a third\" of townships. Independent observers note the real number is likely far higher, with as few as 72 out of 330 townships remaining under the control of the Tatmadaw, the military forces aligned with the junta. However, the townships under the control of the junta still included all major population centres.\n\n\nBy late March 2021, dozens of protesters had travelled to Myanmar's border areas to enlist in and train under one of the country's many insurgent groups,\n elevating the risk of a countrywide civil war.\n The \n also proposed the formation of a \"federal armed force\" to combat the military,\n and in late March the \n (AA) threatened to end its ceasefire with the military should the latter \"persist in \n civilians\".\n\n\nDuring late March, protesters increasingly began arming themselves with homemade weapons in an attempt to defend themselves against attacks by the military. Clashes with soldiers and \n attacks against administrative buildings and police stations became more common and protesters slowly became armed resistance.\n\n\nAfter about thirty years of dormancy, the \n (PLA), the armed wing of the \n (CPB), became active again on 15 March 2021 when communist fighters crossed from China into \n where the Kachin Independence Army would provide them weapons.\n and by August 2021, the CPB established a new armed wing to fight against the junta.\n Over the next two years, the PLA would grow its presence in \n, where they fight alongside the PDF, claiming to have 1,000 active troops in December 2023.\n\n\nThe unrest across the nation and the increased need for junta troops in previously peaceful urban areas strengthened EAOs. The Kachin Independence Army had already been on the offensive since February and \n near the town of \n on 25 March 2021.\n The next day, the \n (KNLA) attacked a military base, killing 10 junta soldiers and taking others hostages in their first attack since the protests began.\n The following day saw the \n where protestors openly used homemade weapons against soldiers for the first time, targeting security forces attacking a protest camp.\n\n\nThe military junta declared that it would cease all military operations on 29 March 2021 and hold bilateral negotiations with ethnic armed groups. However, the Kachin Independence Army continued its offensives stating that the Myanmar Army had not ceased operations.\n Seven insurgent groups who were signatories to the \n aligned themselves with the \n (NUG), including the \n (ABSDF) and the \n (KNU).\n The \n, comprising the \n, the \n and the \n, attacked a police station in \n, Shan State, killing at least 10 police officers and indicating their disregard of the junta's call for a ceasefire.\n In response, on 11 April 2021, the junta military launched \n using airstrikes and ground troops, but had to retreat amidst heavy casualties.\n\n\nOn 26 April, the \n became one of the first large-scale conflicts arising from the 2021 coup. The \n (CDF) began armed resistance in \n and the \n declared \n.\n After a soldier allegedly fired at protestors, fighting between the two sides erupted.\n The battle lasted four days, killing 30 junta soldiers and left Mindat abandoned as more than 10,000 people fled the area.\n\n\nOn 16 April 2021, pro-democracy politician \n announced the formation of the \n, with members of ethnic minority groups in senior roles. As part of the announcement he said that ousted leaders \n and \n would retain their positions and asked the international community to recognize their government over the junta.\n Throughout April, informal clashes with protestors intensified, such as in \n when protesters fought back against soldiers with hunting rifles and firebombs on 8 April.\n\n\nThe National Unity Government then declared the formation of an armed wing, the \n (PDF) – on 5 May 2021, a date that is often cited as the start of the civil war. The PDF was formed to protect its supporters from military junta attacks and as a first step towards a Federal Union Army.\n The PDF clashed with the Tatmadaw in the town of \n on 23 May, killing at least 13 members of Myanmar's security forces.\n\n\nIn early June, fighting erupted in \n where the military and Karen \n battled against a combined Karen and PDF force, leaving dozens of junta troops killed.\n Members of the Karenni PDF in \n also captured and destroyed several Tatmadaw outposts near the state capital, \n.\n Towards the end of May, the Tatmadaw used artillery and helicopters to strike PDF positions in Loikaw and \n.\n On 30 May, the KIA joined the PDF in a battle against junta troops in \n, killing eight regime soldiers. Fighting also sprouted up in other Kachin State townships, including Putao, Hpakant and Momauk.\n\n\nWhile there were fewer conflict deaths between May and September, there were still many armed clashes and a spike in early June.\n Two dozen local officials appointed by the military were assassinated throughout the month of June with hundreds of bombings at police stations, banks and government offices.\n On 22 June, junta forces using armoured vehicles raided a safehouse of the PDF in Mandalay, detaining several fighters.\n Myanmar security forces killed at least 25 people in another raid in \n.\n These attacks occurred in Central Myanmar, also known as Anyar, an area that had rarely seen armed violence in recent times.\n On 2 July, troops assaulted several villages in \n and reportedly killed 41 civilians. \n described Myanmar was sliding toward \"bloody \n\".\n\n\nOn 7 September 2021, the NUG declared a \n across the nation and launched what they called the \"people's defensive war\" against the military junta.\n The declaration of war increased the number of skirmishes and clashes between PDF militias, EAOs and the military junta across the country.\n According to the NUG in September 2021, over 1,700 junta soldiers had been killed and 630 wounded in fighting during the preceding three months.\n Several major clashes took place from September to October in \n, \n, \n, \n and \n.\n\n\nOn 18 September, the \n, a pro-junta militia active in the \n, aided the junta in capturing a resistance base near \n.\n\n\nBy late September 2021, 8,000 residents of \n town, Chin state, fled to \n, India after their houses were set ablaze by the junta army.\n Ambushes by anti-junta forces in \n also killed at least 20 soldiers.\n On 16 November 2021, junta forces overran and captured the base camp of Kalay PDF in southwestern \n, killing 2 fighters and capturing 9 Kalay PDF \n.\n\n\nIn October, junta-controlled media reported that at least 406 junta informants had been killed and 285 wounded since 1 February in targeted attacks by resistance forces.\n\n\nAccording to analyst Matthew Arnold, the civil war's momentum passed a critical threshold by the end of the 2022 dry season where the revolutionary sentiment had grown into a broader social and armed resistance that the junta could no longer suppress.\n Towards the end of 2021, direct armed clashes gave way to more bombings, \n and landmines. The PDF, with the strong ground support from local communities, attacked soft government targets like \n stations, outposts and junta-owned businesses. Through these, the resistance became more organised as they seized weapons, got training and communicated between units through the help of the NUG and allied EAOs.\n According to the \n, roughly 2,200 junta soldiers and militiamen were killed in the first half of 2022.\n\n\nOn 17 November 2021, dozens of junta soldiers ambushed an outpost of the \n PDF in \n, Shan State, forcing outnumbered PDF soldiers to retreat.\n At least four junta soldiers were killed during a four-day clash in \n with the KNDF and \n.\n\n\nOn 14 December, around 200 \n troops searched the \n (KNU)-controlled town of \n near the \n, arresting people suspected to be activists or members of the PDF.\n On 20 December, Tatmadaw forces burned down nineteen houses in Kunnar, \n after taking it from the KNDF the week before.\n\n\nOn 24 December, more than \n when they were ambushed by junta troops outside the village of \n in \n.\n Two staff members of the aid group \n were among those killed.\n The \n condemned the attack and called for a \"thorough and transparent investigation\" into the incident.\n\n\nThroughout February and March 2022, the junta carried out repeated air strikes against civilian targets in villages in \n, \n and \n. On 17 February alone, around 20 junta soldiers and 20 resistance fighters were killed in clashes in \n, southern \n.\n Witnesses described soldiers systematically looting jewelry, cash, vehicles, and other valuables. \n reported these actions as \n against the country's ethnic minorities.\n\n\nFighting broke out in parts of \n on 14 April.\n The number of refugees on the Thai border increased after increased combat in \n.\n On 15 April, junta soldiers suffered at least 30 casualties after being pushed back by the KNLA at the battle for \n.\n\n\nThe \n historical heartland of Myanmar had rarely seen armed violence in the \n as a predominantly Buddhist and \n farming region. The fighting in the \n of Central Myanmar starting in 2021 changed this trajectory. Without the presence of EAOs, the Bamar PDF groups are characterized as local cells acting autonomously towards simple and directed towards the 2021 coup. In the 2021-2022 dry season, the PDFs began to work more closely together and coordinate towards larger goals.\n In early 2022, resistance forces were fighting in \n, the capital of \n.\n Resistance attacks on the junta saw the junta retaliate on civilians\n Targeted personnel attacks increased, killing various junta personnel and destroying equipment.\n The PDF also suffered losses, with 12 fighters killed in a battle in \n.\n Many cities saw violent clashes during 2022's \n.\n \n also saw fighting, with casualties on both sides.\n\n\nThroughout the 2021–2022 dry season, various groups in \n carried out ambushes against military outposts and convoys. The \n (KIA) and the PDF attacked convoys in \n and \n townships.\n In October, they also partially shut down gold mining operations run by junta allies.\n After an ambush near \n, the Tatmadaw responded with airstrikes and ground attacks against KIA bases in \n and \n Townships.\n In early February, the KIA assaulted several military bases in Kachin and Shan States, reportedly burning one in Hpakant Township down. The junta responded by increasing airstrikes and send reinforcements to the area.\n\n\nThe \n (CDF) and the \n (CNA) raided and ambushed outposts and convoys in \n and \n Townships.\n In December, the Tatmadaw recaptured the town of \n from the CDF in an offensive that destroyed over a quarter of the town's buildings.\n\n\nOn 14 January 2022, units of the CNA moved into Senam village, south of \n, in neighboring \n to attack a base run by the Indian-based \n. After several hours of fighting, between 10-20 Manipuri rebels and 1 CNA fighter were killed.\n\n\nDuring this time, there were several cases of \n across Myanmar utilizing homemade explosives, including several accidents killing resistance fighters. On 17 June 2021, an army vehicle exploded in \n, Yangon, allegedly killing several military personnel.\n On 14 December, Tatmadaw troops captured 12 suspected resistance fighters after several bombs accidentally exploded in \n, Yangon.\n \n became less practical, so resistance forces began targeting junta-aligned officials. According to junta-aligned sources, 367 junta-appointed officials were assassinated in targeted attacks between February 2021 and February 2022.\n Resistance forces also began targeting the homes of junta pilots in \n in response to airstrikes on civilians.\n\n\nFighting also occurred in other \n-majority regions. On 31 January 2022, at least 36 junta soldiers were reportedly killed in ambushes over three days in Magwe, Sagaing and \n and Chin, Shan and Kayah states.\n\n\nThe intensity of fighting decreased during the \n season.\n Resistance forces were advantaged by the rainfall as the junta could not carry out air strikes as easily.\n In June, resistance groups achieved control of 40–50% of the country. \n claimed to administer most of \n with an independent government. \n and \n made plans to establish a new government. The KIA and the \n, a neutral \n independent region of Myanmar, consolidated expanded territories.\n However, the \n retained tight control of almost every city in Myanmar and most of the country's natural resources, including important jade mines.\n During this time, the PDF were also unable to move beyond rural guerilla tactics. \n, acting president of the NUG, cited the lack of weaponry and international support as reasons for the prolonged conflict.\n\n\nOn 31 May 2022, a \n killed one person and injured nine others near the \n in \n, the largest city in Myanmar. State media accused the \n of being responsible for the attack, which the PDF denied.\n A July clash in \n, Shan State also killed around 40 junta soldiers and 11 PDF fighters.\n\n\nThe military deployed its time-tested counterinsurgency methods in what has been called a \"hammer approach\" of bombing and burning villages and massacring civilians to flush out rebel groups. However, the approach was ineffective because they were unable to consolidate power or deter the resistance.\n\n\nMyanmar military forces executed at least 37 villagers in the \n in May 2022 after shelling the village of \n, Sagaing Region with heavy artillery.\n The junta forces entered the local \n, conscripted young male villagers briefly before executing them and other captives by a \n.\n\n\nOn 23 July 2022, the \n announced that it had executed four political prisoners, including \n and \n, which was the first use of \n since the late 1980s.\n The men had been accused of helping the resistance movement.\n The event was widely seen as a provocation to escalate the ongoing conflict by the Tatmadaw.\n The international community, including United Nations Secretary-General, the G7 nations and the \n strongly condemned the executions.\n\n\nAccording to a special report from \n, junta soldiers following a raid in Kachin state’s Se Zin village in August 2022, set fire to more than 400 homes with at least 15 people killed on the spot, detained some 400 people in and around Se Zin, and about 100 of them have been killed (including \n) by security forces between August 2022 and January 2023 while others died due to horrific prison conditions.\n\n\nOn 16 September 2022, the Burmese military killed 11 children and wounded another 17 in the \n, as part of an airborne strike conducted against a school in \n, Sagaing Region.\n The military claimed that the village was harbouring resistance fighters from the KIA and PDF.\n The attack was widely condemned by the \n, including the \n and \n.\n\n\nLater in September 2022, retired Brigadier General \n, mentor to \n vice-chairman Senior General \n, was assassinated by anti-regime guerilla groups in \n. This assassination caused an increase in security on high-ranking junta personnel.\n\n\nIn early 2022, the \n and the junta clashed again in northern \n. On 8 February, Arakan Army and junta forces clashed on at least two occasions in \n in Rakhine State. Fighting broke out on 4 February when junta troops carried out a sneak attack on an AA outpost near the Letpan Mountains northeast of Mee Taik Village, killing an AA \n, according to AA spokesman Khaing Thukha. Three hours of clashes were also reported on 6 February. The clashes raised fears of a breakdown of the informal ceasefire between the AA and the military which had been in place since November 2020.\n Further clashes in northern Maungdaw on the night of 7 February killed two civilians.\n Several junta troops, including a major, were also killed in the attack.\n\n\nBetween June and August 2022, the informal ceasefire reached in late 2020 between the \n (AA) and the junta broke down. The AA had consolidated control during this period, avoided the initial violence of the war, and introduced many public services and local administrators in northern \n. With the military's attention diverted to the increasing resistance elsewhere and increasing popular support for an alliance with the NUG, the AA sought to expand its influence into southern Rakhine.\n Rhetoric from AA leader \n in June grew more provocative with military spokespeople stating that the AA was inviting conflict.\n Armed clashes resumed in July after the junta launched an airstrike against an AA base in \n, killing 6 AA soldiers. AA retaliated in \n and western \n in late July and early August. By late August, land travel to northern Rakhine required passing a series of checkpoints and all public transport ships ceased operation due to river and land blockades.\n\n\nOn 16 August 2022, two mortar shells fired by the \n landed in a \n refugee camp in \n, killing one man and injuring five others. \n helicopters allegedly entered Bangladeshi air space to attack the \n and fired a shell within Bangladeshi air space. Two days later, \n summoned Myanmar ambassador Aung Kyaw Moe to strongly protest the land and airspace violations.\n In October 2022, Bangladeshi Foreign Minister \n made a statement that border bombings by Myanmar stopped after he met with the \n, Li Jiming.\n\n\nIn mid-October 2022, \n issued a statement calling for the victory of the \n by the end of 2023. This call to action was followed by increased fighting by the resistance forces in urban areas and in Southeastern Myanmar.\n This development took place in the wake of the junta torching at least 20 villages in the \n and \n as part of a \"\n\" strategy of attacking civilians to weaken anti-regime movements. According to Sagaing-based resistance spokespeople, many victims of arson then joined the resistance.\n The urgency of the resistance was likely prompted by the looming elections planned by the \n.\n The fragmentated nature of the grassroots elements of the PDF became more organized in 2022 through the command of the NUG and from cooperation with various EAOs- especially the \n (KIA).\n\n\nThe \n (KNDF) claimed in January 2023 that 1,692 regime troops and 211 resistance fighters were killed since the 2021 coup, 293 civilians had been killed by the regime, and 126 displaced civilians died while fleeing their homes in Kayah and Shan states in 2022.\n\n\nThe \n stepped up fighting, besieging the major town of \n on the Thai border in the 21 October 2022 \n.\n The battle began with surprise attacks on the \n and at government offices within the town. Resistance forces looked poised to take the town, but ultimately withdrew two days later after facing junta air strikes and strategically drawing junta troops away from nearby positions.\n Four days later, undeterred KNLA-led forces seized a junta Light Infantry Battalion base in \n.\n\n\nIn \n, clashes between PDF forces near \n and the \n (PNO) broke out after the PNO coerced villages for speedboats and militia recruits.\n\n\nIn late 2022, \n resistance forces used drones in a week-long siege of an outpost in \n, killing 74% of the junta forces stationed, but failing to take the outpost against aerial bombardments.\n In February 2023, \n captured \n police station and took control of the town.\n In \n, the \n (SNA) became more actively allied with the junta as conflict between SNA and the KIA grew. In August, the SNA and the \n set fire to hundreds of homes in Kachin state forcing KIA withdrawal from the area.\n\n\nChin forces also targeted convoys on roads within the state. In March 2023, combined Chin resistance consisting of \n, \n, and \n conducted multiple ambushes on a regime convoy between \n, \n and \n capturing and destroyed multiple armoured vehicles.\n The NUG awarded the combined Chin forces 400 million \n for seizing two armoured vehicles.\n The following day, the groups attacked another junta convoy carrying 80 troops on the road between \n and \n, killing over 30 junta soldiers.\n In April, CNDF attacked a junta base on the Kalay-Falam road near Varr, \n, killing eleven regime soldiers and capturing fourteen.\n\n\nIn November 2022, resistance in \n increased. In \n, western Bago Region, the PDF attacked a police building using \n.\n In eastern Bago, 15 junta soldiers were killed in a Bago PDF raid on a police station in \n.\n Thousands of civilians also fled \n as joint KNLA and NUG-led resistance forces seized three military outposts.\n\n\nIn early December, a video of \n forces beating and shooting a woman dead emerged on social media. The NUG Ministry of Defence said that the incident happened in June in \n, Sagaing and that they were investigating the incident after detaining the perpetrators involved.\n\n\nIn early January 2023, PDF groups in \n, Sagaing Region attacked junta supply ships, killing at least 25 soldiers. The junta increasingly used waterways for supplies, avoiding roadways in resistance-held areas.\n In April 2023, a combined PDF force from nearby townships seized the Tower Taing hill base Kani Township, killing 30 junta soldiers and seizing weapons.\n\n\nIn early 2023, the Mandalay PDF announced their intentions to ramp up military operations.\n Alongside the TNLA, they engaged in a series of intense clashes with the junta forces in \n near the \n-\n border, killing at least 75 junta soldiers and wounding 60 others.\n A combined force of at least 900 junta and pro-junta militia troops attacked resistance positions with the help of artillery attacks and airstrikes during the clashes but were forced to retreat.\n\n\nIn 2023, the number of attacks in urban areas increased. In March 2023, the \n group Urban Owls assassinated Minn Tayzar Nyunt Tin, a legal and money-laundering aide to the junta with links to former Air Force commander General \n, in \n, Yangon. Minn Tayzar Nyunt Tin helped draft the repressive Cyber Security Law, which was seen as violating digital rights, privacy and freedom of expression.\n\n\nIn October 2022, battles and skirmishes increased, as the junta committed several civilian atrocities. On 21 October, junta forces \n, a high school teacher from \n, and impaled his head on a \n-administered school's spiked gate after burning and looting \n village in \n.\n\n\nTwo days later, on 23 October, over 80 people were killed by \n in \n, Northern Myanmar, during an anniversary celebration for the \n (KIO). At least 80 civilians were killed, making it the single deadliest attack on civilians since the start of the renewed civil war.\n The junta denied civilian casualties while the United Nations condemned the attack.\n\n\nIn November 2022, the junta continued burning villages in \n, including the home village of \n \n, the head of the \n.\n Junta soldiers also hid in civilian trucks impersonating workers to ambush local defence forces in \n.\n\n\nOn 2 February 2023, \n imposed martial law in 37 townships with resistance activity, affecting millions of residents.\n\n\nIn November 2022, the \n allowed the greater use of the \n to weaken resistance forces' ability to maintain strategic positions and outposts. Aerial bombardment, helicopter raids and artillery strikes typically followed skirmishes once junta ground forces sustained substantial losses and retreated. Once the entrapped forces were relieved by aerial support, they would engage in \n tactics. World War Two veterans described the destruction as worse than that of the \n of \n due to the deliberate targeting of civilian villages.\n The heavy use of air forces came alongside a decrease in junta's ability to fight on the ground. During the week of 21 November, repeated junta air attacks along the \n-\n border killed 80 and disrupted supply chains between the two resistance regions.\n The junta's \n campaign stretched across northern Myanmar, burning bases and villages they could no longer defend.\n Thousands of residents fled during the campaign as hundreds of homes were destroyed.\n In early 2023, one scorched earth push by the junta aimed to resecure the \n in \n for Chinese foreign workers planning to leave for their holidays.\n\n\nOn 23 February 2023, army troops launched a new military offensive in Sagaing, raiding and pillaging villages at the confluence of the \n and \n. During the offensive, troops from the 99th Light Infantry Division executed at least 17 villagers during the \n.\n\n\nOn 26 November 2022, the \n and the junta agreed to a temporary ceasefire starting on 27 November. The ceasefire was brokered by \n of the \n. Arakan Army spokespeople maintained that they agreed to the ceasefire for humanitarian reasons, as opposed to international pressure. The Arakan Army did not withdraw from fortifications held at the time of the ceasefire.\n Junta spokespeople said that this was the first step towards a permanent ceasefire with the Arakan Army.\n As of mid-December, tensions remained high with forces from both sides remaining in deployment within northern \n.\n\n\nOn 30 November, the military launched a major assault on the \n \n using heavy weapons on a base near \n by the \n. This assault continued into 2 December, reportedly sending 500 junta soldiers.\n\n\nThe military continued its campaign in northern Shan State against the \n (TNLA). On 7 December 2022, the junta launched a ground offensive on the TNLA in the Battle of \n using aerial bombs.\n After six days of fighting, the TNLA captured four villages from junta control, killing 70 soldiers and capturing 28. On 17 December, the junta retreated, claiming that they reached an agreement with TNLA, and that they intended to target the PDF forces and attacked the TNLA in mistake. The TNLA rejected the statement.\n Continued clashes in late December forced over a thousand civilians to flee to \n.\n\n\nAccording to analysts in early 2023, the civil war was in a state of stalemate. Despite several successful engagements, there was still a significant disparity in power between the joint resistance forces and the junta. The PDF and EAOs faced resource constraints as they primarily relied on donations for funding and underground channels to acquire arms.\n The resistance also increasingly used coordinated drone attacks, such as on 27 August 2023, when 11 resistance groups jointly conducted drone strikes in \n, killing 17 soldiers.\n \n\nIn early April, the \n (KTLA) launched an offensive on the Karen State \n (BGF)-held \n in retaliation for the imprisonment and killing of the group's spokesperson by the BGF. After the reported capture of 5 BGF bases,\n by 8 April, the offensive began to stall. After junta/BGF counterattacks, the KTLA was forced to retreat, receiving heavy losses. Afterwards, the KNU stated that they did not approve these attacks, nor that they would accept the KTLA in their territory.\n\n\nIn early June 2023, NUG announced the formation of the PDF's first battalion in \n – Battalion 5101.\n On 19 June 2023, the Urban Owls guerilla group assassinated Ye Khaing, the operations director and head of security of \n, and a former air force major, outside his house at \n, Yangon. Ye Khaing was allegedly providing information to the junta and detaining anti-junta activists at Myanmar's primary international airport.\n Urban Owls also claimed that Ye Khaing was a confidante of \n, the owner of \n, which operates the airport, and is a major supporter of the regime together with the second-in-command, Senior General \n.\n\n\nIn late June 2023, a combined resistance force of PDF and KNLA took control of the \n in \n, installing checkpoints and arresting junta personnel.\n Also in June, the \n-based resistance group Ye Belu launched successive guerrilla attacks on the junta in June 2023. On 22 June, they attacked a junta security checkpoint at Chaung Taung bridge, killing four soldiers and one official working for the junta's \n in \n.\n On 26 June, the group assassinated a \n leader in \n, Ye Township.\n Two days later, they ambushed an army convoy from the junta's No. 19 Military Operations Command, killing five soldiers and injuring others.\n The attacks caused a breakdown in junta administration in Ye Township. All administration offices in three towns - namely, Lamaing, \n and \n - closed down.\n\n\nOn 10 August 2023, junta forces clashed with a coalition of several rebel groups at \n, near \n. The rebel forces aimed to capture the 606th Light Infantry Division Headquarters.\n On 15 September 2023, members of the Northern Thandaung Defence Force, along with the Lethal Prop drone unit, attacked the Aye Lar military base near the \n with 2 makeshift bombs. It was the first documented drone attack by resistance forces against an airbase.\n\n\nOn 31 August and 9 September, the \n (ZRA) raided 2 \n (CDF) outposts in \n, killing 2 CDF soldiers. These attacks were not the first between the ZRA and Chin resistance\n, which have been clashing since 2021, and came despite the ZRA issuing a public statement of support for anti-junta resistance in 2021.\n\n\nIn August 2023, the NUG claimed that 3,012 junta troops were killed between January and July 2023.\n In Kayah state alone, 667 military junta troops and 99 resistance members were killed.\n In a September interview, \n claimed that resistance forces had taken effective control of about 60% of Myanmar's territory.\n\n\nIn early June 2023, a coalition force of \n and other resistance forces ambushed junta forces at Don Tha Mi bridge checkpoints on the border of \n and \n, inflicting heavy casualties.\n The next day, resistance groups raided the police station and junta offices in \n, Karen State, killing 10 junta soldiers and injuring 15. The junta retaliated with artillery fire and deployed attack helicopters, killing two local civilians and a monk.\n\n\nIn \n on 13 June 2023, the \n (KNPLF), who had previously been in a ceasefire with the junta and became a \n in 2009, openly defected to anti-junta forces. The KNPLF began attacking Burmese military positions, joining forces with \n, \n, KNLA, and PDF,\n and seizing junta outposts in the \n. The combined forces took over \n in Eastern \n.\n 430 soldiers of the Light Infantry Battalion, including their \n commander, surrendered to the resistance.\n Later in July, KNLA forces and allies captured the Lat Khat Taung hill junta base. During an attempt to recapture the hill, 20 junta soldiers were killed and 34 wounded.\n\n\nFrom July to September 2023, the \n and the \n jointly conducted \n against junta forces in the \n. Over that period, 76 junta soldiers were killed, 19 were wounded, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition were seized.\n\n\nOn 27 October 2023, the \n initiated an offensive they called \n, targeting the junta's checkpoints and bases near \n and the Phaung Seik border trade post near \n.\n Chinshwehaw fell into ethnic armies' hands. \n and two important China-Myanmar border crossings near \n were closed.\n Over the next three days, the coalition forces captured 57 bases to which the junta responded with aerial bombardments.\n Simultaneously, the AA engaged junta forces in \n, Sagaing Region.\n\n\nOn 30 October, \n fell under limited TNLA and Mandalay \n control\n and 41 junta combatants in \n surrendered to the MNDAA.\n The next day, combined AA and KIA forces captured Gangdau Yang base on the \n-\n road.\n A junta convoy came the next day to reinforce Nawnghkio but TNLA and PDF forces blew up an armored car, took weapons and \n. The convoy retreated and established a camp in southwest \n, which was assaulted by the rebel forces the following morning.\n The junta acknowledged having lost control of three towns in Northern \n, including \n.\n TNLA, MNDAA, and AA declared control over four towns, including \n.\n\n\nOn 6 November, TNLA forces seized bridges and road gates near \n, and took the town after a three-day assault.\n \n also fell to the coalition, marking the first \n capital seized during the operation.\n Over the next three days, the coalition took \n, \n and \n across northern Myanmar, re-establishing local government functions after securing towns.\n They also took Panlong base in \n, killing Brigadier General Aung Kyaw Lwin in the battle,\n and the strategic Goktwin bridge near the \n on the main \n-\n highway.\n\n\nOn 17 November, the TNLA captured the Sakhan Thit Kone base in \n, but lost it to a junta offensive the following day. The TNLA accused the junta of using \n bombs during the counter-siege.\n Through December, the TNLA seized \n and \n taking over the \n from junta control.\n\n\nOn 29 November, the \n (SSPP) and the \n (RCSS) declared a truce between their respective armies in response to the Operation, with the SSPP stating that the 2 armies \"[intended] to unite as one in the future.\"\n\n\nIn early December, the Tatmadaw allegedly reached out to China for it to assert pressure on the \n to stop Operation 1027.\n On 11 December, China helped to hold peace talks between the Tatmadaw and various rebel groups, including the Brotherhood Alliance.\n The Brotherhood Alliance announced later on 13 December that these peace talks \"lasted only 10 minutes\" and vowed to continue fighting.\n\n\nIn late January 2024, \n said that the \"bloody two-year stalemate\" of the civil war appears to \"have been broken\" with the success of the offense of the three ethnic armies in the Operation 1027 offense.\n\n\nOn the morning of 13 November 2023, as part of \n, the \n (AA) attacked two \n stations in \n, breaking the Rakhine State Ceasefire Agreement between the junta and the Arakan Army. Dong Paik camp was captured by 6:30 am.\n On 14 November, the junta had already abandoned around 40 outposts in \n after attacks by the Arakan Army, but few came under their immediate control.\n Dozens of Myanmar security officers surrendered to the Arakan Army the following day.\n\n\nOn 14 November, the Arakan Army launched an offensive in \n in neighbouring \n. The Arakan Army accused the Tatmadaw of using chemical weapons during the ensuing battles.\n\n\nThe following night, the Arakan Army launched an attack on \n, seizing the \n police station. By the next morning, the Arakan Army had taken control of the town. The junta sent two \n alongside naval support to fire back, including at civilian housing, with heavy machine gun fire. Pauktaw's proximity to the Rakhine state capital, \n, posed a threat to the junta.\n Junta forces detained about 100 residents who were unable to flee, and positioned themselves to surround the town, using two navy ships to blockade the harbour.\n\n\nOn 6 December, the Arakan Army would captured a major military base in the township.\n\n\nIn late November and December, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) closed in on \n, the capital of the \n. They seized several strategic positions from junta forces during the ensuing \n.\n MNDAA forces attacked junta bases around the city in early December, including the Four Buddhist Statues Hill outpost immediately south of \n.\n On 26 December, over 90 of the junta's 55th Light Infantry Division surrendered to the MNDAA.\n The artillery shelling of Laukkai stopped and the city mostly fell under MNDAA control on 28 December.\n On 5 January 2024, the MNDAA seized control of the Northeast Command's headquarters in Laukkai and gained full control of the city.\n\n\nA few days later, the Three Brotherhood Alliance claimed it had captured the towns of \n and \n on 8 January after seizing junta military posts in the towns, including the headquarters of the \n in Theinni.\n On 23 January, the Tatmadaw sentenced three of the brigadier generals who surrendered at Laukkai to death and the other three to \n, under \n.\n\n\nIn the wake of these gains and the fall of Laukkai, on 12 January, \n announced that it had negotiated another \n between the junta and the Three Brotherhood Alliance, known as the \"Haigeng Agreement\".\n The two sides agreed to disengage personnel and pledged not to compromise the safety of Chinese border residents.\n According to the Brotherhood Alliance, they had agreed not to seize more towns in northern Shan and that the junta had agreed not to shell or strike that area.\n However, the following day, the TNLA reported that the junta had broken their ceasefire agreement with airstrikes in various townships in Northern Shan, including \n and \n.\n\n\n reported on 22 November 2023 that the Tatmadaw was preparing 14,000 soldiers for the defence of \n, including by moving troops from other regions to the capital and mobilizing civil servants into the military. These preparations started soon after Operation 1027 was launched against the Tatmadaw. In addition, the Tatmadaw was preparing 10,000 troops for the defence of \n, \n and \n. There were also fortification works beginning, with Naypyitaw police stations \"also preparing concrete blocks, sandbags and other materials needed to transform into defensive bases in just a few days\".\n\n\n, a professor at \n, stated that the recent strategic reversals, nationwide territorial losses and economic decline meant momentum had strongly shifted away from Myanmar's junta, and the junta \"may now be in a death spiral\".\n\n\nOperation 1027 was supported by several concurrent operations by other anti-junta groups elsewhere in the country, including in the eastern regions \n and \n. In northern Shan State, the KNLA and \n clashed with the Tatmadaw around the town of \n in late October 2023.\n In \n (part of Kayah State), the KNPLF, KA and KNDF launched a joint military operation called \n that captured several border posts starting on November 7.\n Four days later, they launched the major \n against \n, the capital of Kayah State.\n The military operations in Kayah displaced tens of thousands of civilians, especially from Loikaw.\n After over a month of heavy fighting, rebel forces had won control of 85% of the capital.\n Nonetheless, fighting has continued into January.\n By late January, however, the offensive on Loikaw had mostly stalled.\n\n\nOther anti-junta forces launched \n in \n, Mandalay Region. On 13 November, fighting erupted in Kinn Village, eastern Madaya Township between the TNLA and the junta, who responded with air and artillery strikes and later burning the village down.\n By 28 November, PDF and TNLA forces captured a junta base in the township.\n The TNLA additionally supported the operations with attacks in \n and \n Townships in southern \n to cut off junta reinforcements.\n\n\nOn the morning of 13 November 2023, after two days of fighting, the \n (CNA), along with local \n (CDF) units, captured the town of \n on the \n.\n This marked the first town captured by resistance forces in Chin State since the start of armed resistance following the coup. At least 40 junta soldiers and police officers fled to the neighboring Indian state of Mizoram, where they surrendered to local police before being turned over to the \n. They were subsequently repatriated back to Myanmar.\n\n\nOn 15 November 2023, the \n (CNDF), the armed wing of the Chin National Organization (CNO), a Chin nationalist political organization, captured a Myanmar Military camp at Tibual village near the border with Mizoram, India.

Groups not a part of the alliance took advantage of the situation, but remained constrained by both tense relations and limited coordination.\n\n\nOn 8 January 2024, the \n continued Operation 1027 and captured the Taung Shey Taung base and its 200 junta soldiers in \n, Rakhine State. They then escalated their offensive into \n, Chin State with the aim of capturing \n, a strategic town for the Indo-Myanmar \n On 15 January, the Arakan Army seized Paletwa and the entire township, declaring it a \"military council-free area.\"\n A week later, the Arakan Army captured the town of \n in Rakhine State concluding a three-month battle.\n\n\nOn 3 February 2024, as the clashes between Arakan Army and Tatmadaw increased in Rakhine, mortar shells and several bullets reportedly landed in Bangladesh territory, which injured some local residents near \n, Cox's Bazar.\n At least 229 Myanmar \n (BGP) personnel entered Bangladesh through the Tumbru border point seeking refuge from AA, where the \n (BGB) disarmed them and gave them shelter in \n.\n \n\nBetween 4 February and 6 February, the Arakan Army launched attacks on Rakhine BGP outposts in Maungdaw Township, later alleging without providing evidence that the \n and \n (RSO) fought alongside the Rakhine BGP.\n The RSO denounced AA's accusations and the AA labeling them as \"\n\" among other issues.\n Later in February when the junta began conscripting largely non-citizen \n \n living in \n, the AA urged Rohingya people to flee into AA-controlled areas.\n \n\nThe Arakan Army captured most remaining Tatmadaw bases in \n by 6 February, almost taking full control of \n.

In response, Thailand deployed the \n along the border.\n The junta began sending reinforcements in a counteroffensive to retake the town, but were stalled in \n.\n On 12 April, Thai officials and the KNU spokesperson confirmed the capture of Myawaddy, with the KNU stating it was preparing to establish its own administration in the town.\n The junta retaliated with airstrikes despite locals stating that the KNLA were not in the streets of the town.\n\n\nDespite the KNLA's major role in capturing Myawaddy, the KNLA and PDF groups ceded the city's control to the \n (KNA), \n (KNU/KNLA-PC), and the \n (DKBA-5) to ensure security within the city.\n According to the KNU/KNLA-PC, the KNA was playing a major role in negotiations between the KNU and the junta regarding Myawaddy.\n\n\nAfter Myawaddy's capture, the Light Infantry Division (LID) 55, numbering around 1,000 and reportedly led by the junta \n \n, began attempting to cross the \n to recapture the town in a counteroffensive known as \"Operation Aung Zeya\".\n Early in the counteroffensive, KNLA forces withdrew from \n.\n The LID 55 was continually intercepted by the KNLA and allies, being forced to retreat and reportedly experiencing heavy losses.\n Late on 19 April, the KNLA began launching attacks on the remaining 150 junta soldiers from the LIB 275th which retreated under the 2nd Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge on 10 April, the last junta \n in the town. The junta responded with airstrikes, killing several civilians and forcing the KNLA to delay their attacks on the LIB 275th.\n On 21 April, a junta convoy participating in Operation Aung Zeya was \n in Kawkareik Township after a resistance ambush, allowing the KNLA to capture several military vehicles.\n Despite this, Kawkareik town was entirely recaptured from Karen forces the next day.\n On 23 April, junta forces from the LIB 275th, which had been sheltering under the 2nd Friendship Bridge, were assisted by the Karen National Army in reoccupying their base outside Myawaddy.\n The next day, the KNU spokesmen stated that they would \"temporarily withdraw\" from Myawaddy, but stated that the KNLA would continue guerrilla attacks on junta positions along the \n.\n\n\nAfter being trapped in Kawkareik Township for several weeks due to resistance ambushes and attacks, the 1,000 men reinforcements sent by the junta to aid forces in Myawaddy in Operation Aung Zeya began advancing through the Dawna Range, reaching the Taw Naw waterfall by 29 April.\n\n\nAfter Operation 1027, Karenni resistance continued with \n and \n to capture \n and its capital \n. On 7 January, joint Karenni forces launched an offensive to capture \n in neighboring Shan State, capturing most of the town and \n by 12 January.\n On 29 January, the \n (KNDF) captured the town of \n.\n On 14 February, combined forces of the \n (KA) and KNDF captured the town of \n after almost a month-long battle. This capture made \n the second Kayah township completely captured by Karenni forces, after \n.\n By 5 March, Karenni forces captured the \n Bridge. After this capture, junta jets attacked a monastery in the town, killing five and wounding 20 internally displaced people (IDP).\n Later, on 14 March, Karenni forces captured the rest of Hpasawng and most of \n.\n In a joint statement on 23 March, the KNDF and allies announced that they were in control of nearly 90% of Kayah State. They further stated that they had captured 65 junta positions throughout the state, and six out of nine towns in Kayah\n (excluding Moebye in Southern Shan State).\n On 10 April, the Karenni National Solidarity Organisation (KNSO), a \"people's militia force\" under the junta, declared war on the junta and joined resistance groups after an over 20-year ceasefire.\n\n\nOn 20 January, local resistance forces in \n began intensifying attacks around the township, announcing their intent to capture \n.\n On 14 February 2024, the \n (MNLA-AMD) split from the \n (a signatory of the \n) and effectively declared war on the junta.\n The splinter group's leadership, made up of senior MNLA officials, stated that they would only be active in areas the MNLA was not\n and intended to unite with local resistance forces.\n Around 22 March, several Mon State-based resistance groups, began vehicle inspections along the road stretching from the Malwe Mountain to \n, prompting junta forces to close the road.\n On 25 March, the MNLA-AMD, alongside the KNLA and several allies, captured the Kawt Bein Police Station in \n, Karen State.\n In response, junta forces shelled Kawt Bein and surrounding settlements.\n 2 days later, Mon resistance captured nearby Dhamma Tha village.\n\n\nOn 8 April, Mon PDF forces launched drone attacks on the Southeastern Command headquarters in \n while \n, deputy commander-in-chief of the junta, was in the building. Whether Soe Win was affected remains unknown.\n On 19 April, the MNLA-AMD began launching attacks on a junta convoy in \n heading towards Myawaddy to recapture the city from anti-junta forces.\n On 25 April, after a day long battle involving around 300 junta troops, junta forces recaptured the town of Kawt Bein and Dhamma Tha from Mon resistance.\n\n\nOn 4 April 2024, the People's Defense Force launched an unprecedented drone attack against Aye Lar airbase, the main Tatmadaw headquarters, and Min Aung Hlaing's residence in the capital, \n. Almost 30 drones were deployed; junta forces claimed 7 were shot down.\n \n said 13 fixed-wing drones were shot down and there were no casualties or damage to property. NUG claimed the attack was \"a success\".\n On 12 April, local People's Defense Forces claimed that they killed over a dozen junta soldiers in another attack on Aye Lar Airbase.\n\n\nThe human rights situation in Myanmar has deteriorated substantially since the beginning of the civil conflict. The Burmese military has escalated its use of \n, including murder, mass killings, sexual violence, torture, arbitrary detention, attacks on religious buildings, and the targeting of civilians.\n The junta has also seized the properties of political opponents as part of an intimidation strategy, impacting hundreds of families.\n \n News reports that the pro-junta paramilitary \n have been accused of more than one atrocity against civilians.\n\n\nSince the onset of the civil conflict, both the Burmese military and resistance forces alike have used educational facilities as bases and detention sites.\n In 2021, over 190 violent attacks on schools were reported in 13 of Myanmar's states and regions.\n As of June 2022, 7.8 million children remained out of school.\n\n\nMyanmar's public health system has effectively collapsed,\n and the civil war has worsened the country's food security crisis, with one in four people experiencing food insecurity.\n Poverty and food insecurity have disproportionately affected Myanmar's \n and the Irrawaddy delta regions, which account for over 80% of the country's agricultural area and are home to a third of the country's population.\n\n\nAs of September 2022, 1.3 million people had been internally displaced, and over 13,000 children had been killed.\n By March 2023, the UN estimated that since the coup, 17.6 million people in Myanmar required humanitarian assistance, while 1.6 million were internally displaced, and 55,000 civilian buildings had been destroyed.\n\n\nIn March 2023, \n, the \n, reported that armed conflict had continued to grow. He stated that they were investigating hundreds of incidents of houses being burnt and civilians, including children, being killed. Overall, 15.2 million people faced \n.\n\n\nIn March 2024, \n, the \n, stated that 18.6 million people were in need of humanitarian aid.\n\n\nEconomic conditions in Myanmar have substantially worsened due to the ongoing war and to economic mismanagement by the SAC.\n In 2021, Myanmar's GDP declined by 5.9%.\n In an interview, Christian Lechervy, the French ambassador to Myanmar, highlighted the impact of the coup on the country's economy: \"In 2021, Myanmar's economic growth has contracted by more than 18%, poverty has doubled, the number of people in need of humanitarian aid has multiplied by seven and more than 450,000 people have been forced to flee their homes\".\n Between March and June 2022, almost 10,000 people per month left the country through official channels, worsening the country's \n and mirroring the civilian exodus that followed the \n and \n.\n The local job market has collapsed.\n \n\nIn September 2022, the G7-led \n announced plans to blacklist Myanmar for failing to stem money laundering and terrorist financing.\n At that time, only Iran and North Korea were on the \n.\n In October 2022, Myanmar was blacklisted by the task force, which increased volatility in the value of the Burmese kyat.\n\n\nThe war disrupted transport and stunted the export of agricultural goods like rice and corn, and the \n of \n became an economic pillar for many Burmese. Myanmar became the world’s biggest \n producer, producing about 1,080 metric tons in 2023.\n\n\nDuring the war, there has been a \"mass refusal\" among Myanmar's people to pay taxes and other charges to the junta, leading to a 33% drop in state revenue according to an analysis by the \n (SAC-M). According to the SAC-M, \"69% of businesses reported not paying tax to the junta in the first three months of 2022\". The cessation of payments of electricity bills by large portions of the population has also significantly cut off the junta's revenue sources.\n\n\nAs of September 2022, the value of the \n has depreciated by over 60%,\n while basic commodity prices have increased by up to 57%.\n The \n estimated Myanmar's economy contracted by another 18% in 2022.\n Since April 2022, the country has experienced foreign currency shortages, which have acutely impacted importers, resulting in shortages of basic products like medicines and fertilisers.\n The military regime has imposed foreign currency controls, which has worsened the shortage of US dollars among international firms operating in the country.\n Many foreign and multinational companies, including Telenor, Ooredoo, Chevron, \n, and \n have exited the Burmese market as the conflict has intensified.\n\n\nAt the end of July 2023, the SAC announced that it would issue a limited number of new 20,000 kyat banknotes. The announcement led to an increase in the price of gold, as well as in foreign currency exchange rates.\n In early 2024, it was reported that the civil war had \n of every day goods, such as rice (160–220%), fuel (520%), and palm oil (75%) from pre-war levels. Also, the US dollar to Kyat exchange rate had increased by 160%.\n In April 2024, the price of gold was around 4.5 million kyat per \n (a \n of mass) compared to 1 million per \n in February 2021. The SAC regularly accuses goldsmiths of price manipulation when gold prices rise. An arrest of five traders and closure of seven shops, caused the price to drop in early April 2024 as traders were fearful of doing business.\n\n\nThe \n established an Interim Central Bank (ICB) led by their Planning, Finance and Investment minister, Tin Tun Naing. The goal of establishing this bank is to contest foreign reserves and assets held by the Central Bank in \n.\n It was also reported that the ICB seized 44 billion Kyats from other banks.\n \n explained in regards to Central Banks raising funds for their government; \"The NUG has acknowledged raising over $150 million since the coup\" and that while \"it dwarfs in comparison to the revenue of the junta, which gave itself a raise of 51 percent in FY2023 to $2.7 billion—it's not insignificant either.\"\n\n\nUnder the direction of the ICB there is a newly established for-profit bank called Spring Development Bank, with an intent to establish its own cryptocurrency.\n\n\nThe deterioration in law and order in many parts of Myanmar has caused \"a surge in illegal mining activities\" in rural parts of the country. Environmental activists in Myanmar have accused the junta of supporting illegal mining of \n which have \"devastating and unpredictable consequences for the region’s ecosystem and inhabitants\". Rivers have been contaminated, causing the destruction of local ecosystems, decreasing community access to clean water and disrupting agricultural activities of local farmers. The junta has cracked down on environmental activists who have criticized the government.\n The conflict has also seen a significant rise in \n.\n\n\nA February 2022 report by \n \n stated that \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n were selling the weapons to the junta.\n The \n documented the use of \n weaponry by the junta in November 2023.\n\n\nAnti-junta forces have claimed that the Tatmadaw has severely struggled with recruitment and morale.\n Desertion is a growing problem.\n\nOn 31 January 2023, the \n issued a directive enabling organisations and citizens deemed \"loyal to the state,\" including civilians, civil servants, and army personnel, to obtain \n.\n The regulatory shift has enabled the military junta to arm pro-junta \n and to suppress pro-democracy forces in light of waning military recruitment and their challenges with concurrently operating in multiple \n throughout the country.\n On 12 February 2023, a leaked document purportedly from the \n detailed the junta issuing firearms licenses to pro-regime civilians for the operation of counter-insurgency paramilitaries based on the new firearm licensing directive.\n\n\nJunta-aligned Pyusawhti militias have reportedly used force to recruit local men, but have been less than effective in building up grassroots enforcement on behalf of the junta, and have \"taken root only in the small number of communities where the military's own party is traditionally strong.\"\n\n\nOne man contacted by the BBC in the area where Wathawa has been mobilising since early 2022 said he had only been able to recruit a maximum of 10–15 men in each village, and then only by threatening to burn down their homes.  \nHe said many of the recruits had run away, and were being helped by other villagers to hide from Wathawa and his gun-toting monks.\nIn early December 2023, the Tatmadaw-led government appealed for \n to return, promising the deserters exoneration. The \n claims some 20,000 soldiers had deserted and joined its ranks.\n By 7 December, the junta began freeing soldiers who had been jailed for \n to ease apparent manpower shortages as a result of battlefield pressures from recent operations.\n\n\nOn 10 February 2024, the Tatmadaw announced the \n, requring all men aged 18 to 35 and women aged 18 to 27 to complete up to two years of \n, amid its territorial losses. Those who fail to enlist face imprisonment for up to five years during a national emergency.\n This announcement has been interpreted by some as a sign of increasing desperation in the face of steadily advancing resistance forces.\n In the wake of the announcement, \n also reported that \"thousands\" of young people were fleeing across the border to \n to \n before it came into effect.\n Local Myanmar government officials are reportedly \n bribes from those seeking to \n.\n 21 administrators in Rakhine's \n announced their resignation in response to the military recruitment.\n Rebel groups killed at least 37 local officials carrying out the junta's conscription efforts.\n\n\nActivist \n thought the military’s historic \"indoctrination techniques are deeply rooted in nationalism and religious ideologies\" leaving \"soldiers and their families feeling disoriented amidst shifting societal paradigms\".\n\n\nThe limited possession of guns by ethnic insurgent movements along with the lack of international support and formal means of acquiring military material has presented the anti-junta forces with a challenging situation for the confrontation of the military regime. Faced with this difficulty since the early stages of armed insurgency, the resistance movement sought ways to manufacture the necessary weapons and equipment for the conflict. Initially, the rebels expanded the production of a traditionally made, \n \n known as \n, especially in the \n. Nonetheless, this kind of rifle is severely limited for battleground action. For this reason, the fighters have developed alternative models which are more advanced, while still calling them \n.\n Since then, the resistance movement has developed many kinds of \n, \n and bomb drones, to be manufactured within the technological and material means of liberated territories and underground cells.\n\n\nCommercially available drones rigged to carry bombs were used to attack military positions. PDF groups reportedly produced naval bombs to target government logistics in rivers. Meanwhile, defected soldiers developed 60 mm long-range \n. The use of \n was also reported, both to salvage weapons taken from the junta and for the improvised production of semiautomatic carbines.\n An arms trafficker in possession of \n was found working with an unnamed insurgent ethnic armed group in Myanmar.\n The success of \n enabled the Brotherhood Alliance to seize enormous caches of arms and ammunition from the Tatmadaw, making it better equipped than before it launched Operation 1027.\n\n\nIn June 2021, the \n passed a non-binding resolution asking member states to impose an arms embargo on Myanmar.\n Two hundred international organisations, including \n and \n have continued to press the UN and its member states to adopt a global arms embargo.\n The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the \n have, in response to the ongoing violence, sanctioned individuals and organisations associated with the Burmese military.\n However, the effectiveness of these sanctions has been undermined by poor coordination among governments and the lack of sanctions against high-impact targets.\n\n\n blocked Myanmar from participating in regional summits after the 2021 coup.\n but this was reversed after \n invited the junta to two \n hosted in \n in April 2024.\n ASEAN member states have not taken a consistent, coordinated approach with respect to the ongoing civil war, due to internal divisions. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore are strongly opposed to the military junta,\n but \n was a key ally of the junta until the election of \n as prime minister.\n\n\nIndia, which represents Myanmar's fourth-largest export market and fifth-largest import partner, has continued a business-as-usual approach to cross-border relations and continues to recognize the military junta.\n State-owned and private Indian companies supply arms and raw materials to the junta.\n On the other hand, \n, which a part may have contributed to India's ongoing support for the junta as a balance attempt to prevent Chinese encroachment, which is met with criticism.\n\n\n recognizes the military junta, but does not support its actions, in part because the \n has led to around 1 million \n.\n Its position in the conflict has been informed by repeated \n into its territory.\n\n\nAs of December 2023, \n remains the only government to have openly expressed sympathies to the anti-regime forces in Myanmar.\n In August 2023, the \n expelled the East Timorese ambassador in retaliation for the East Timorese government meeting with the NUG.\n\n\nSince the coup d'état, \n and \n have supported the military junta and have been its main arms suppliers. China is Myanmar's largest trading partner.\n The two countries have blocked any substantive action against Myanmar's military at the United Nations Security Council, while Myanmar's security forces have reportedly used Chinese and Russian-supplied weapons to perpetrate human rights violations.\n Chinese support for the junta has led to a rise in popular \n.\n However, the fact that the Three Brotherhood Alliance's \n in late 2023 was carried out near the \n may indicate a shift in China's stance,\n which was attributed by analysts to concerns about cyber-scam centers, the pursuit of favorable concessions from the junta on the \n, and the opportunity to influence the PDF in light of evolving dynamics between NUG and EAO groups.\n\n\n has embraced deeper ties with the Burmese military junta as the civil war has progressed. Russia has provided \n, military training for over 50 \n pilots, and diplomatic backing to the regime.\n Min Aung Hlaing has visited Russia several times, personally meeting with Russian president \n in September 2022. The military junta backed the \n.\n Russia was among the few countries\n to send a congratulatory message to the junta on Myanmar's \n.\n In March 2024, Tom Andrews saw Russia still being the number one source of weapons for the junta.\n\n"},

Fighting has been concentrated around the capital city of \n and the \n region.\n As of 21 January 2024, at least 13,000\n–15,000 people had been killed and 33,000 others were injured.\n As of 21 March, over 6.5 million were internally displaced and more than two million others had fled the country as refugees,\n and many civilians in \n have been reported dead as part of the \n.\n\n\nThe war began with attacks by the RSF on government sites as airstrikes, artillery, and gunfire were reported across Sudan. The cities of Khartoum and \n were divided between the two warring factions, with al-Burhan relocating his government to \n as RSF forces captured most of Khartoum's government buildings. Attempts by international powers to negotiate a ceasefire culminated in the \n, which failed stop the fighting and was ultimately abandoned.\n\n\nOver the next few months, a stalemate occurred, during which the two sides were then joined by rebel groups who had previously fought against Sudan's government. By mid-November, the \n and \n factions of the \n officially joined the war in support of the SAF, alongside the \n (JEM).\n In contrast, the \n movement joined forces with the RSF, while the \n faction of the \n attacked SAF positions in the south of the country.\n\n\nStarting in October 2023, momentum began to swing toward the RSF, as the paramilitary defeated army forces in Darfur and made gains in \n, \n, and \n. Since February 2024, the SAF has made gains in Omdurman as part of the 2024 Omdurman offensive. Further negotiations between the warring sides have so far produced no significant results, while many countries have provided military or political support for either al-Burhan or Hemedti.\n\n\nThe \n has consisted of foreign invasions and resistance, \n, \n, and \n.\n Since \n in 1956, Sudan has experienced more than 15 \n and usually been ruled by the military, interspersed with short periods of democratic parliamentary rule.\n\n\n between the \n and the \n, which led to the independence of \n in 2011, killed 1.5 million people, and a \n displaced two million people and killed more than 200,000 others.\n\n\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Sudan's western \n region had endured prolonged instability and social strife due to a combination of racial and ethnic tensions and disputes over land and water. In 2003, this situation erupted into a full-scale rebellion against government rule, against which president and \n \n vowed to use forceful action. The resulting \n was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of \n and \n against al-Bashir.\n The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million were forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful.\n\n\nTo crush uprisings by non-Arab tribes in the \n, al-Bashir relied upon the \n, a collection of \n militias which was drawn from camel-trading tribes which were active in Darfur and portions of \n. In 2013, al-Bashir announced that the Janjaweed would be reorganized as the \n (RSF) and he also announced that the RSF would be placed under the command of the Janjaweed's commander \n, more commonly known as Hemedti.\n The RSF perpetrated mass killings, mass rapes, pillage, torture, and destruction of villages and were accused of committing \n against the \n, \n, and \n peoples.\n Leaders of the RSF have been indicted for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity by the \n (ICC),\n but Hemedti was not personally implicated in the 2003–2004 atrocities.\n In 2017, a new law gave the RSF the status of an \"independent security force\".\n Hemedti received several gold mines in Darfur as patronage from al-Bashir, and his personal wealth grew substantially.\n Bashir sent RSF forces to quash a 2013 uprising in South Darfur and deployed RSF units to \n and \n.\n During this time, the RSF developed a working relationship with the Russian private military outfit \n.\n These developments ensured that RSF forces grew into the tens of thousands and came to possess thousands of \n which regularly patrolled the streets of Khartoum.\n The Bashir regime allowed the RSF and other armed groups to proliferate to prevent threats to its security from within the armed forces, a practice known as \"\n\".\n\n\nIn December 2018, protests against al-Bashir's regime began, starting the first phase of the \n. Eight months of sustained civil disobedience were met with violent repression.\n In April 2019, the military (including the RSF) \n, ending his three decades of rule; the army established the \n, a \n.\n Bashir was imprisoned in Khartoum; he was not turned over to the ICC, which had \n.\n \n continued; in June 2019, the TMC's security forces, which included both the RSF and the SAF, perpetrated the \n, in which more than a hundred demonstrators were killed\n and dozens were raped.\n Hemedti denied orchestrating the attack.\n\n\nIn August 2019, in response to international pressure and mediation by the \n and Ethiopia, the military agreed to share power in an interim joint civilian-military \n (the \n), headed by a civilian Prime Minister, \n, with \n.\n \n in a coup led by \n (SAF) leader \n and Hemedti. The Transitional Sovereignty Council was reconstituted as a new military junta led by al-Burhan, monopolizing power and halting Sudan's transition to democracy.\n\n\nThe \n (or Army; SLM, SLA, or SLM/A) is a rebel group active in Darfur, primarily composed of members of non-Arab ethnic groups\n and established in response to their marginalization by the Bashir regime.\n Since 2006, the movement has split into several factions due to disagreements over the \n, with some factions joining the government in Khartoum.\n By 2023 the three most prominent factions were the SLM-Minnawi under \n, the SLM-al-Nur under \n, and the SLM-Tambour under \n. The SLM-Minnawi and SLM-Tambour signed the 2020 \n, ceasing hostilities and receiving political appointments, but the SLM-al-Nur had refused to sign and kept fighting.\n\n\nThe SPLM-N was founded by units of the predominantly South Sudanese \n/Army stationed in areas that remained in Sudan following the \n. These forces then led a rebellion in the southern states of \n and \n a few months later.\n In 2017, the SPLM-N split between a faction led by \n and one led by \n, with al-Hilu demanding \n as a condition for peace while Agar did not agree with this.\n During the Sudanese Revolution, al-Hilu's faction declared an indefinite unilateral ceasefire.\n In 2020, a peace agreement was signed between the Sudanese government and Agar's faction,\n with Agar later joining the Transitional Sovereignty Council in Khartoum. Al-Hilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the Sudanese government a few months after.\n Further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup, and the al-Hilu faction instead signed an agreement with the SLM-al-Nur and the \n, agreeing to co-operate in order to draft a 'revolutionary charter' and remove the military from power.\n\n\nIn the months after the 2021 coup the already weak \n steeply declined, fueling wide protests demanding that the junta relinquish power back to civilian authorities.\n Tensions arose between the two junta leaders over al-Burhan's restoration to office of old-guard \n officials who had dominated the Omar al-Bashir government. Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics. This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab.\n Hemedti's expression of regret over the October 2021 coup signals a widening divide between him and al-Burhan.\n\n\nTensions between the RSF and the SAF began to escalate in February 2023, as the RSF began to recruit members across Sudan.\n Throughout February and early March the military built up in the Sudanese capital of \n, until a deal was brokered on 11 March and the RSF withdrew.\n As part of this deal negotiations were conducted between the SAF, RSF, and civilian leaders, yet these were delayed and halted by political disagreements.\n Chief among the disputes was the integration of the RSF into the military: the RSF insisted on a 10-year timetable for its integration into the regular army, while the army demanded integration within two years.\n Other contested issues included the status given to RSF officers in the future hierarchy, and whether RSF forces should be under the command of the army chief rather than Sudan's commander-in-chief, al-Burhan.\n\n\nOn 11 April 2023, RSF forces were deployed near the city of \n as well as in \n.\n Government forces ordered them to leave, and were refused. This led to clashes when RSF forces took control of the Soba military base south of Khartoum.\n On 13 April, RSF forces began their mobilization, raising fears of a potential rebellion against the junta. The SAF declared the mobilization illegal.\n\n\nOn 15 April 2023, the RSF attacked SAF bases across Sudan, including \n and \n.\n There were clashes at the headquarters of the state broadcaster, \n, which was later captured by RSF forces.\n Bridges and roads in Khartoum were closed, and the RSF claimed that all roads heading south of Khartoum were closed.\n The next day saw a SAF counteroffensive, with the army retaking \n alongside the headquarters of Sudan TV and the state radio.\n\n\nThe Sudan Civil Aviation Authority closed the country's airspace as fighting began.\n Telecommunications provider \n shut down Internet services, and by 23 April there was a near-total Internet outage across Sudan. This was attributed to electricity shortages caused by attacks on the electric grid.\n Sudanese international trade began to break down, with \n, one of the largest shipping companies in the world, announcing a pause on new shipments to the country.\n\n\n directed his forces to capture or kill al-Burhan, and RSF units engaged in pitched and bloody combat with the \n. Ultimately al-Burhan managed to evade capture or assassination, but his base at the Sudanese Armed Forces Headquarters was eventually placed under RSF siege, rendering him unable to leave Khartoum.\n In an interview with \n, Hemedti accused al-Burhan and his commanders of forcing the RSF to start the war by scheming to bring deposed leader \n back to power.\n He called for the international community to intervene against al-Burhan, claiming that the RSF was fighting against radical Islamic militants.\n\n\nFollowing the first few days of war the SAF brought in reinforcements from the Ethiopian border.\n Although a \n was announced for \n, fighting continued across the country.\n Combat was described as particularly intense along the highway from Khartoum to \n and in the industrial zone of al-Bagair.\n Intercommunal clashes were reported in \n and in \n.\n\n\nBy the beginning of May the SAF claimed to have weakened the RSF's combat capabilities and repelled their advances in multiple regions.\n The \n deployed its \n in the streets of Khartoum in support of the SAF, claiming to have arrested several hundred RSF fighters.\n The SAF announced it was launching an all-out attack on RSF in Khartoum using air strikes and artillery.\n Air strikes and ground offensives against the RSF over the next few days caused significant damage to infrastructure, but failed to dislodge RSF forces from their positions.\n\n\nFollowing further threats to his life from Hemedti, al-Burhan gave a public video address from his besieged base at the Army Headquarters, vowing to continue fighting.\n On 19 May, al-Burhan officially removed Hemedti as his deputy in the Transitional Sovereignty Council and replaced him with former rebel leader and council member \n.\n With al-Burhan trapped in Khartoum, Agar became \n leader of the Sudanese government, assuming responsibility for peace negotiations, international visits and the day-to-day running of the country.\n\n\nInternational attention to the conflict resulted in the \n calling a special session to address the violence, voting to increase monitoring of human rights abuses.\n On 6 May, delegates from the SAF and the RSF met directly for the first time in \n, \n for what was described by \n and the \n as \"pre-negotiation talks\".\n After diplomatic lobbying from the Saudis and Americans the warring sides signed the \n on 20 May, vowing to ensure the safe passage of civilians, protect relief workers, and prohibit the use of civilians as \n.\n The agreement did not include a ceasefire, and clashes resumed in \n, causing more casualties.\n The United Nations \n \n expressed frustration at the lack of commitment from both sides to end the fighting.\n\n\nThe situation remained volatile, with both sides trading blame for attacks on churches,\n hospitals,\n and embassies.\n Casualties mounted, particularly in Geneina, where Arab militias loyal to the RSF were accused of atrocities against non-Arab residents.\n A temporary ceasefire was signed and faced challenges as fighting persisted in Khartoum, and the agreed-upon ceasefire time saw further violence.\n Between 28 and 97 people were reportedly killed by the RSF and Arab militias when they attacked the predominantly \n town of \n in West Darfur on 28 May.\n\n\nAs June began, Khartoum witnessed tank battles resulting in casualties and injuries.\n The RSF took control of several important cultural and government buildings, including the \n and the \n.\n Acute food insecurity affected a significant portion of Sudan's population.\n\n\nBy July, al-Burhan was still trapped at the Army Headquarters and unable to leave, and in order to break him out the SAF elected to send a column of troops to lift the siege of the base. This force was ambushed by the RSF and defeated, with the paramilitary claiming it had killed hundreds of soldiers and captured 90 vehicles, along with the column's commander.\n\n\nIn response to the escalating violence in Khartoum the SAF increased the intensity of their airstrikes and artillery bombardment, leading to heightened civilian casualties often numbering in the dozens per strike.\n Shelling by the RSF also increased in intensity, leading to many civilian casualties in turn.\n\n\nHeavy fighting continued in Khartoum throughout August, with clashes breaking out across the city. The RSF laid siege to the SAF's Armoured Corps base, breaching its defences and taking control of surrounding neighbourhoods.\n The SAF also made offensives, with the RSF-controlled \n and Yarmouk Complex coming under SAF air bombardment. An offensive was launched against Yarmouk, but this was beaten back after the RSF shipped in reinforcements.\n One of the few remaining bridges between Khartoum and \n was also destroyed by the SAF, in an attempt to deny the RSF freedom of movement.\n\n\nOn 24 August a SAF military operation successfully rescued al-Burhan from his besieged base at the Army Headquarters, allowing him to head to \n and hold a cabinet meeting there.\n\n\nCeasefires between the warring parties were announced but often violated, leading to further clashes. The SAF and RSF engaged in mutual blame for incidents, while the Sudanese government took actions against international envoys.\n The Saudi embassy in Khartoum was attacked, and evacuations from an orphanage were carried out amid the chaos.\n Amidst the turmoil, Sudan faced diplomatic strains with Egypt, leading to challenges for Sudanese refugees seeking entry.\n\n\nWith al-Burhan out of Khartoum for the first time since the start of the war, he was able to fly to Egypt and hold a meeting with the Egyptian President \n.\n Following this visit al-Burhan went on a tour of numerous countries, heading to South Sudan, Qatar, Eritrea, Turkey, and Uganda.\n He then proceeded to \n as head of the Sudanese delegation to the 78th \n, where he urged the international community to declare the RSF a terrorist organization.\n\n\nThe \n faction of the \n (SPLM-N) broke a long-standing ceasefire agreement in June, attacking SAF units in \n, \n and \n, the latter coinciding with an attack by the RSF. The SAF claimed to have repelled the attacks,\n while the rebels claimed to have attacked in retaliation for the death of one of their soldiers at the hands of the SAF and vowed to free the region from \"military occupation\".\n More than 35,000 were displaced by the fighting.\n Speculation arose as to whether the attacks were part of an unofficial alliance between al-Hilu and the RSF or an attempt by al-Hilu to strengthen his position in future negotiations concerning his group.\n Civil society organizations supporting the SPLM-N claimed its operations sought to protect civilians from possible attacks by the RSF.\n\n\nAl-Hilu's faction launched further offensives in July, moving into \n and gaining control of several SAF bases.\n In response the SAF brought in artillery and heavily bombarded SPLM-N positions.\n Further attacks by the group largely petered out after this, with an assault on Kadugli in September being pushed back by the SAF.\n\n\nIn Darfur fighting and bloodshed was particularly fierce around the city of \n, where hundreds died and extensive destruction occurred.\n RSF forces engaged in frequent acts of violence against the \n population of Geneina, leading to accusations of \n.\n On 4 August the RSF claimed that it had taken full control over all of \n.\n\n\nA \n investigation discovered numerous mass graves in Darfur that contained Masalit civilians.\n The RSF and Arab militias were additionally accused of having killed lawyers, human rights monitors, doctors and non-Arab tribal leaders.\n The governor of \n, \n, was abducted and killed by armed men in June, hours after accusing the RSF of genocide and calling for international intervention in a TV interview.\n The SAF, for their part, conducted indiscriminate airstrikes against Darfur that killed many civilians, especially in \n.\n\n\nTribal and rebel groups in Darfur began to declare allegiance to one or the other of the warring parties. A faction of the Darfur-based \n led by \n (SLM-T) joined the conflict in support of the SAF.\n In contrast the controversial \n rebel group formally declared its alliance with the RSF, joined by the leaders of seven Arab tribes, including that of Hemedti's.\n\n\nAs September arrived both sides made offensives in Darfur. The RSF took control of several towns in \n and also attacked the market of \n, the capital of \n.\n SAF offensives saw success in \n, with the army retaking parts of \n from the RSF.\n Fighting in Darfur also began to increasingly spill over into \n, with the SAF attacking RSF positions in the state capital of \n and clashes over the town of \n.\n Both sides made withdrawals to end the month, with the RSF retreating from Um Rawaba while the SAF withdrew from \n.\n\n\nBy October, the SAF in Darfur was experiencing acute shortages in supplies due to RSF-imposed sieges, and had failed to utilize its air superiority to stem RSF advances.\n On 26 October, the RSF \n, Sudan's \n, after seizing control of the SAF's 16th Infantry Division headquarters.\n The fall of Nyala, a strategic city with an international airport and border connections to Central Africa, allowed the RSF to receive international supplies more easily and concentrate its forces on other Sudanese cities.\n After Nyala's fall, RSF fighters turned their focus to \n, the capital of Central Darfur. The SAF's 21st Infantry Division, stationed in Zalingei, fled the city without a fight and allowed the RSF to take it over.\n\n\nIn Geneina, reports emerged that tribal elders were attempting to broker the surrender of the SAF garrison in the city to prevent bloodshed.\n The army rejected the proposal, raising fears of an imminent RSF assault on the city and causing civilians to flee across the border into Chad.\n The RSF besieged the headquarters of the SAF's 15th Infantry Division in Geneina, giving the garrison a six-hour ultimatum to surrender.\n The base was captured two days later when the 15th withdrew from the area before fleeing to Chad in haste.\n Those left behind, numbering in the hundreds, were taken prisoner and paraded in RSF media with signs of abuse.\n Witnesses later reported of mass atrocities perpetrated by the RSF in the city shortly after its seizure, with a local rebel group claiming up to \n in Geneina's satellite town of \n.\n With Geneina's fall, \n and Al-Fashir were the last remaining capitals in Darfur under government control, with both cities under heavy RSF pressure.\n\n\nThe RSF stormed and plundered the town of \n, east of Al-Fashir, after the SAF garrison withdrew.\n SAF troops in Al-Fashir itself were reported to be running low on food, water, and medicine due to the city being under siege, and external forces noted the SAF seemed incapable of stopping the RSF advance.\n Ed Daein fell in the early hours of 21 November, with RSF forces taking control of the city after seizing the headquarters of the SAF's 20th Infantry Division.\n SAF garrisons in East Darfur subsequently abandoned their positions and withdrew, allowing the RSF to occupy the area.\n In response to RSF gains in Darfur and subsequent abuses, the \n, \n, and other smaller rebel factions renounced their neutrality and declared war on the RSF.\n\n\nAttempts by other nations and international organisations to negotiate peace had largely been dormant since the failure of the Treaty of Jeddah, but in late October the RSF and SAF met once more in Jeddah to attempt to negotiate peace.\n This new round of talks was a failure, with neither side willing to commit to a ceasefire. Instead, the warring factions agreed to open channels for humanitarian aid.\n On 3 December negotiations were indefinitely suspended due to the failure of both the SAF and the RSF to open up aid channels.\n\n\nWith the failure of the talks in Jeddah, the East African \n (IGAD) hosted a peace summit in early December. Earlier attempts by IGAD to open negotiations had floundered after the SAF had accused Kenyan President \n of supporting the RSF.\n IGAD's talks appeared to make more progress than the Jeddah negotiations, with Hemedti and al-Burhan agreeing to meet in person at some point in the future.\n\n\nThe RSF attacked the town of Wad Ashana in North Kordofan on 1 October along a key commercial route.\n In West Kordofan, an uptick in fighting was reported, with the RSF assaulting a \"vital\" oil field in Baleela, south of \n.\n Geolocated footage showed RSF fighters celebrating around Baleela Airport after allegedly capturing it.\n The Battle of Khartoum continued with the RSF seizing the town of al-Aylafoun, southeast of the capital, on 6 October. In the process, the paramilitary gained control of key oil infrastructure.\n By late October the RSF controlled most of Khartoum but had failed to seize key military bases, while al-Burhan's government had largely relocated to Port Sudan.\n\n\nThe RSF sought to capitalize on its gains by stepping up attacks on SAF positions in Khartoum and Omdurman. Days of fighting culminated in the destruction of the \n, which connected Khartoum North to Omdurman over the Nile; the bridge's destruction severing a critical RSF supply chain.\n This effectively cut the RSF off from its forces in Omdurman, giving the SAF a strategic advantage.\n In an attempt to gain a new crossing over the Nile and supply its forces in Omdurman, the RSF launched an assault on the \n in the village of \n.\n As Jebel Aulia could not be destroyed without flooding Khartoum, its capture would give the RSF a path over the Nile the SAF could not easily remove. A week-long battle commenced over the dam and its surrounding village, which ended in an RSF victory. The force captured the dam on 20 November, all SAF resistance ceasing in the village the following day.\n\n\nOn 5 December, local militias along with RSF soldiers attacked SPLM-N (al-Hilu) forces in the village of Tukma, southeast of Dalang in South Kordofan, resulting in the deaths of 4 people and the destruction of the village.\n The RSF leadership, not wanting hostilities with the neutral al-Hilu faction to escalate, issued a statement condemning this attack and denouncing it as \"tribal violence\".\n On 8 December, the RSF entered \n for the first time.\n\n\nPushing south from their gains around Jebel Aulia and Khartoum, RSF forces began to move into \n on 15 December, advancing toward its capital \n.\n Elsewhere in Gezira the RSF made major gains, taking control of the city of \n in the state's east and entering the \n region.\n After several days of fighting the RSF seized the Hantoob Bridge on Wad Madani's eastern outskirts, crossing the \n and entering the city.\n The army put up little resistance in Wad Madani itself, the 1st Division withdrawing from the city as the RSF took over.\n\n\nThe fall of Wad Madani was viewed as a major blow to the SAF, as it dramatically widened the frontline and opened up large parts of the country to potential RSF offensives.\n The city's fall allowed the RSF to capture most of Gezira and to make inroads in \n, capturing the town of \n.\n Within a few days RSF fighters had advanced to within 25 km of \n, the largest city in \n.\n Over the next few weeks RSF forces ventured into rural areas of \n and \n, without establishing a significant presence. In Sennar State the RSF made some further minor advances, but had not attacked Sennar City by the year's end.\n\n\nAmid the deteriorating situation, the SAF was reported to be arming civilians while government officials in the east called on the population to mobilize.\n Al-Burhan gave a widely promoted public speech to soldiers in \n, promising to arm civilian militias to fight the RSF and to fight against 'colonialism', which was viewed by observers as a reference to the United Arab Emirates' support of the RSF.\n\n\nFollowing the fall of Wad Madani efforts by IGAD to negotiate a ceasefire made progress, as the SAF's weakened position made them more eager to enter talks. Whereas previously opposition from Islamist political groups to negotiation had prevented al-Burhan from committing to a specific date, now both he and Hemedti agreed to meet on 28 December.\n A day before the meeting was due, the Sudanese foreign ministry claimed that they had been contacted by IGAD informing them that the meeting was postponed citing 'technical issues'.\n\n\nInstead the RSF leader went on a diplomatic tour, travelling on a chartered Emirati jet and meeting with several African national leaders.\n One visit that was particularly promoted was his visit to \n, where he met with Rwandan President \n, visited the \n and spoke of Rwanda's recovery from the \n as a model for Sudan to follow.\n On the tour Hemedti also met with former Prime Minister Hamdok and his \n organisation in \n, with the RSF agreeing in a declaration negotiated with the Taqaddum to release political prisoners, open up humanitarian aid corridors and negotiate further with the SAF.\n This tour was regarded by observers as an attempt by Hemedti to portray himself as the leader of Sudan and improve his international image, as his reputation had been severely damaged since the fall of Wad Madani due to large-scale looting by RSF fighters.\n\n\nOn 5 January, al-Burhan vowed to continue the war against the RSF and rejected the latest peace efforts saying \"No reconciliation\", citing the RSF \"committing war crimes and crimes against humanity in West Darfur and the rest of Sudan.\"\n\n\nOn 14 January, both Hemedti and Burhan received official invitations from IGAD to attend its upcoming summit on 18 January. Hemedti took to social media to confirm his attendance and show commitment for peace,\n while Sudan's military junta issued a statement refusing to attend the summit saying that IGAD did not give sufficient reason as to why the summit on 28 December was delayed. On 16 January Sudan suspended its contacts with IGAD accusing IGAD of violating Sudan's sovereignty, setting a dangerous precedent and giving the RSF legitimacy by inviting it to a meeting that will be attended by member heads of state and government. Burhan also accused African leaders of complicity of atrocities against Sudanese civilians. His reaction was regarded by observers as isolating Sudan politically and straining the latest peace efforts.\n\n\nAs 2024 began the RSF made attacks into \n, defeating SAF forces in the town of \n in the \n and pushing toward \n.\n On 7 January the RSF attacked SAF positions in Dalang, meeting fierce resistance from the army and civilian militias.\n During the fighting the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) entered the city, taking control of several neighbourhoods. SPLM-N forces proceeded to attack the RSF, and the paramilitary retreated from the city.\n RSF fighters withdrawing from Dalang entered the city of \n in \n, easily taking control as the city had no organised SAF presence. West Kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the \n, but as tensions began to escalate rumours spread that the RSF was planning an attack on the encircled city of \n and the SAF 22nd Infantry Division garrisoning it.\n\n\nIn January 2024, the RSF focused on consolidating its gains in \n. Fighting was reported on 17 January east of \n, the last major town not under RSF control. The SAF delivered weapons to the city by helicopter, including selectively distributing them among civilians in the town, attempting to bolster its defenses. Sudan's \n selectively recruited and armed civilians based on perceived loyalty.\n\n\nOn 24 January 2024, the RSF launched an attack on Babanusa after encircling the city for months. By 25 January, the RSF gained control of the city center and entered the headquarters of the 22nd infantry division.\n\n\nUntil March 2024, the RSF maintained its positions in Gezira State but was unable to breakthrough.\n The RSF is recruiting in Gezira State to try to capture territory in El-Gadarif from the SAF.\n\n\nThe \n, which has allied with the SAF, helped the SAF build up its forces in \n for a counteroffensive to try to retake \n. In April 2024, the SAF and its allies began the counteroffensive, attacking from the east and west of Wad Madani in an attempt to retake it.\n Clashes were reported in Al-Madina Arab on  15 April.\n\n\nThe SAF gained ground in Omdurman in February 2024, linking up their forces in the northern part of the city and relieving a 10-month siege of their forces in the city centre. The SAF also took control of the \n.\n The Omdurman front is the only area in Sudan where the SAF has carried out a sustained offensive operation, and represents its first major breakthrough of the war.\n\n\nOn 12 March, the SAF defeated an attempted RSF counteroffensive and took control of the headquarters of the \n in Omdurman from the RSF.\n The RSF maintains its control of Khartoum and continues to threaten Khartoum North.\n\n\nAs of April 2024, fighting in Khartoum State is ongoing, with the SAF in control of Omdurman and the RSF in control of Khartoum. The SAF is preparing an offensive to relieve its surrounded bases in \n.\n\n\nOn 15 April, during the \n, at least nine civilians were killed in a renewed offensive by the \n on the city of \n in North Darfur.\n The \n declared war on the RSF and allied with the SAF.\n\n\nAs of May 2024, fighting is ongoing in \n, West Kordofan. The RSF is conducting an offensive to attempt to take control of West Kordofan.\n\n\nSpeaking to SAF troops on 12 April 2024, al-Burhan said that RSF withdrawal from all major urban centers was a precondition to negotiations.\n\n\nAs of March 2024, at least 14,000\n–15,000\n people had been killed and 33,000 others injured, according to the UN.\n The \n claimed on 20 June that more than 5,000 people were killed and about 8,000 were wounded in fighting in \n alone,\n while a Masalit tribal leader told the Sudanese news outlet Ayin Network on 22 July that more than 10,000 people had been killed in the state.\n On 12 June, the \n said at least 959 civilians had been killed and 4,750 others were injured.\n On 15 August, the UN said that at least 435 children had been killed in the conflict.\n Doctors on the ground warned that stated figures do not include all casualties as people could not reach hospitals due to difficulties in movement.\n A spokesperson for the \n was quoted as saying that the number of casualties \"was not small\".\n Sudanese prosecutors recorded over 500 missing persons cases across the country, some of which were \n, and were mostly blamed on the RSF.\n\n\nIn \n, West Darfur, ethnic clashes that began in the last week of April had killed at least 1,100 people,\n while the \n claimed that more than 5,000 people were killed and about 8,000 were wounded in the city.\n In July, a Masalit tribal leader claimed that more than 10,000 people had been killed in West Darfur alone, and that 80% of Geneina's residents had fled.\n\n\nMassacres were recorded in towns such as \n and \n,\n while a mass grave was discovered in Geneina containing the bodies of 87 people killed in clashes.\n Several intellectuals, politicians, professionals and nobility were assassinated. Most of these atrocities were blamed on the RSF and allied Arab militias. The UK government,\n witnesses and other observers described the violence in the region as tantamount to \n or even \n, with non-Arab groups such as the \n being the primary victims.\n Mujeebelrahman Yagoub, Assistant Commissioner for Refugees in West Darfur called the violence worse than the \n in 2003 and the \n in 1994.\n\n\nIn July, authorities reported at least 88 cases of sexual assault on women across the country, most of them blamed on the RSF.\n NGOs estimated that the figure could possibly reach 4,400.\n Activist Hala al-Karib stated that war rape had become an everyday occurrence with both fighting parties participating.\n In 2024, \n reported that Sudanese women were forced to \n or become mistresses to RSF fighters to ensure their families’ safety and access to food.\n\n\nIn the \n, three employees of the \n (WFP) were killed after being caught in the crossfire at a military base. Two other staff members were injured.\n On 18 April, the EU's top humanitarian aid officer in Sudan, Wim Fransen of Belgium, was shot and injured in Khartoum.\n On 21 April, the \n (IOM) reported that one of its local employees was killed in a crossfire while traveling with his family near \n.\n On 20 July, an 18-member team of \n was attacked while transporting supplies to the Turkish Hospital in south Khartoum. By then, the \n had verified 51 attacks on medical facilities and personnel since the conflict began, resulting in 10 deaths and 24 injuries.\n On 25 July, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said 18 aid workers had been killed and over two dozen others were detained or unaccounted for.\n The conflict has led the United Nations to declare Sudan the most dangerous country in the world for humanitarian workers after South Sudan.\n\n\nThe situation was further compounded by attacks on humanitarian facilities, with more than 50 warehouses looted, 82 offices ransacked, and over 200 vehicles stolen. One particularly devastating looting incident in El Obeid in early June resulted in the loss of food \"that could have fed 4.4 million people\".\n\nThe SAF and RSF are accused of threatening, attacking, and killing journalists during the conflict. The \n documented over 40 violations in May alone. Several journalists were injured or killed, and 13 newspapers ceased operations. Humanitarian workers were also targeted, with 18 killed and many others detained.\n\nMedia organizations accused both the SAF and the RSF of threatening, attacking and even killing several journalists during the conflict, with the Sudanese Journalists Syndicate documenting more than 40 such violations during the second half of May alone.\n Aside from the occupation of state media channels, the RSF raided the offices of the newspapers \n, \n and the \n's \n and shot and injured photojournalists Faiz Abubakr,\n and Ali Shata,\n while the SAF was accused of circulating lists of journalists it accused of supporting the RSF.\n\n\n journalist Mohamed Othman was reportedly attacked and beaten in Khartoum while a correspondent and cameramen for the El Sharg news outlet were detained for hours near Merowe airport on the first day of the fighting on 15 April. On 16 June, \n journalists Osama Sayed Ahmed and Ahmed El Buseili were shot by snipers in Khartoum,\n while the RSF detained two of the channel's other reporters, Ahmed Fadl and Rashid Gibril, in Khartoum on 16 May, and subsequently looted Fadl's residence. During a live report on 29 April, \n correspondent Salem Mahmoud was interrupted and questioned by the RSF.\n On 30 June, Radio Zalingei journalist Samaher Abdelshafee was killed by shelling at Hasaheisa refugee camp near Zalingei, where she and her family had fled after fighting in the city.\n Sudan TV photographer Esam Marajan was shot dead inside his home in the Beit El Mal neighborhood of Omdurman in the first week of August.\n Sports photojournalist Esam El Haj was killed during clashes around the Al-Shajara garrison in Khartoum on 20 August.\n Halima Idris Salim, a reporter for \n was killed on 10 October after she was reportedly struck by an RSF vehicle while covering the fighting in Omdurman.\n\n\nThe Sudanese Journalists Syndicate (SJS) reported on 10 August that 13 newspapers had ceased operations due to the conflict, while FM radio stations and channels also halted broadcasts, with journalists grappling with unpaid wages.\n It later reported in December that the RSF had turned the premises of the \n (SBC) into a detention center and was involved in the looting of other media outlets, including the \n's Khartoum branch, and the sale of media equipment, including that of the SBC, in markets in Omdurman.\n\n\nIntermittent telecommunications and internet since the beginning of the conflict, and in particular a near total blackout in February and March 2024 severely limited reporting in and from Sudan. The RSF is reportedly selling access to \n to get around the blackout,\n which allegedly allows them to track journalists.\n In April 2024, the government suspended the licenses of three foreign media outlets (UAE-based \n, Saudi-based \n and Al Hadath),\n while the editor of the now-closed \n said that 23 local print outlets had shut down.\n  Casualties in 2024 include Khalid Balal (a media director), who was fatally shot at his home in North Darfur on 1 March, as well as many journalists who were beaten. Harassment—including sexual harassment—and detention were also reported, including the editor-in-chief of \n a local news outlet, who is under RSF custody as of April.\n\n\nCivilians, including 15 Syrians,\n 15 Ethiopians\n and 9 Eritreans\n have been killed across the country. An Indian national working in Khartoum died after being hit by a stray bullet on 15 April.\n Two Americans were killed, including a professor working in the \n who was stabbed to death while evacuating.\n A two-year-old girl from Turkey was killed while her parents were injured after their house was struck by a rocket on 18 April.\n Two Egyptian doctors were killed in their home in Khartoum and had their possessions stolen on 13 June.\n Ten students from the \n were killed in an SAF airstrike on the \n in Khartoum on 4 June.\n The SAF claimed that the Egyptian assistant military attaché was killed by RSF fire while driving his car in Khartoum, which was refuted by the Egyptian ambassador.\n\n\nTwo Greek nationals trapped in a church on 15 April sustained leg injuries when caught in crossfire while trying to leave.\n A Filipino migrant worker\n and an Indonesian student at a school in Khartoum were injured by stray bullets.\n On 17 April, the \n to Sudan, \n of Ireland, was assaulted by unidentified \"armed men wearing military fatigues\" in his home, he suffered minor injuries and was able to resume working on 19 April.\n On 23 April, a French evacuation convoy was shot at, injuring one person.\n The French government later confirmed the casualty to be a French soldier.\n An employee of the Egyptian embassy was shot and injured during an evacuation mission.\n\n\n, an actress, was killed in a crossfire in Khartoum North.\n A singer, \n, was killed in a crossfire in Omdurman, as was former football player \n and his daughter.\n Araki Abdelrahim, a member of the music group \n, was killed by the shelling of a mosque in the El-Shajara neighborhood of west Khartoum.\n The governor of \n, \n, was abducted and killed by armed men hours after accusing the RSF of genocide and calling for international intervention in a TV interview.\n \n, a former member of \n and a \n, was killed by the RSF in a raid on his house in Nyala.\n\n\nOn 16 April, the RSF claimed that its troops in Port Sudan were attacked by foreign aircraft and issued a warning against any foreign interference.\n According to former \n analyst Cameron Hudson, Egyptian fighter jets were a part of these bombing campaigns against the RSF, and Egyptian special forces units have been deployed and are providing intelligence and tactical support to the SAF.\n \n said that Egypt had sent fighter jets and pilots to support the Sudanese military.\n On 17 April, satellite imagery obtained by \n revealed that one Egyptian Air Force \n fighter jet had been destroyed and two others had been damaged or destroyed at \n. A Sudanese Air Force \n was among the destroyed aircraft.\n After initial confusion, the RSF accepted the explanation that Egyptian combat and support personnel were conducting exercises with the Sudanese military prior to the outbreak of hostilities.\n\n\nOn 15 April, RSF forces claimed, via Twitter, to have taken Egyptian troops prisoner near \n,\n and a military plane carrying markings of the \n.\n Initially, no official explanation was given for the Egyptian soldiers' presence, while Egypt and Sudan have had military cooperation due to diplomatic tensions with \n.\n Later on, the \n stated that around 200 of its soldiers were in Sudan to conduct exercises with the Sudanese military.\n Around that time, the SAF reportedly encircled RSF forces in Merowe airbase. As a result, the Egyptian Armed Forces announced that it was following the situation as a precaution for the safety of its personnel.\n The RSF later stated that it would cooperate in repatriating the soldiers to Egypt.\n On 19 April, the RSF stated that it had moved the soldiers to Khartoum and would hand them over when the \"appropriate opportunity\" arose.\n One hundred and seventy-seven of the captured Egyptian troops were released and flown back to Egypt aboard three Egyptian military planes that took off from Khartoum airport later in the day. The remaining 27 soldiers, who were from the Egyptian Air Force, were sheltered at the Egyptian embassy and later evacuated.\n\n\nA report published by the \n on 10 August 2023 quoted Ugandan officials as saying that an \n plane on a stopover at \n en route to \n International Airport in eastern Chad turned out upon inspection to have been carrying dozens of green plastic crates in the plane's cargo hold filled with ammunition, assault rifles and other small arms\", rather than food and other aid officially listed on the aircraft's manifest supposedly meant for Sudanese refugees. Despite the discovery, the plane was allowed to take off, and the officials said they received orders from their superiors not to inspect any more planes from the UAE. Prior to this, the UAE had long been accused of supporting the RSF. The \n subsequently denied the allegations, saying that the country \"does not take sides\" in the conflict.\n \n\nIn September 2023, \n reported that the UAE had set up a base in Amdjarass airport to support the RSF. Officials from the US, European and African countries claimed that the UAE was running a covert operation to back the RSF. Since June, Emirati cargo planes were identified landing in Amdjarass in Chad, where an airfield and a hospital were being used for the operation. These flights began just as Chad's president \n secured a $1.5 billion loan agreement from the UAE. The UAE insisted its operation was purely humanitarian, but officials stated that it involved supplying powerful weapons and drones to the RSF, treating their injured fighters and airlifting serious cases to their military hospital. The relationship between UAE and the leader of the RTF reportedly dates back to 2018, when Hemedti sent combatants into southern \n to fight against the \n.\n SAF deputy commander Yasir El Atta also claimed that the UAE was also using \n in Chad and another airport in the Central African Republic to deliver weapons to the RSF.\n Following these allegations, protests erupted in Port Sudan on 1 December demanding the expulsion of the UAE's ambassador, while al-Burhan was reported to have cancelled his participation at the \n summit held in \n.\n\n\nOn 10 December 2023, Sudan ordered the expulsion from the country of 15 Emirati diplomats. No reason was provided, but it came amid reports that the UAE had been providing weapons to the RSF.\n The day before, three Sudanese diplomats were ordered expelled from the UAE following comments made by SAF deputy commander Yasser al-Atta during which he accused the UAE of supporting the RSF and called the country a \"mafia state\".\n\n\n, Al-Harith Idriss Al-Harith Mohamed criticized the UAE in a letter to the UN Security Council. In the 78-page complaint, he claimed that the UAE planned and supported the RSF campaigns against the SAF, adding that the UAE used Chad to transport military supplies and mercenaries through its territory. The letter also urged the council to take action and push the UAE to stop supporting the RSF.\n\n\nIn April 2024, the Sudanese government said that the UAE sent new supplies to the RSF through Cameroon and Chad.\n Sudan’s representative to the UN, Al-Harith Idriss submitted a request for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to discuss the UAE’s provision of weapons to the RSF, saying that it “makes the UAE an accomplice in all its crimes”.\n\n\nOn 18 April, an SAF general claimed that two unnamed neighboring countries were trying to provide aid to the RSF.\n According to \n, Libyan warlord \n, who is backed by \n and the Russian paramilitary \n, dispatched at least one plane to fly military supplies to the RSF.\n \n reported that Haftar assisted in preparing the RSF for months before the conflict broke out.\n The \n, which is commanded by Haftar, denied providing support to any warring groups in Sudan and said it was ready to play a mediating role.\n\n\nPrior to the conflict, the UAE and the \n were involved in business deals with the RSF.\n According to \n, Wagner supplied \n to the RSF, picking up the items from \n and delivering some of them by plane to Haftar-controlled bases in Libya to be then delivered to the RSF, while dropping other items directly to RSF positions in northwestern Sudan.\n US officials said that Wagner was offering to supply additional weapons to the RSF from its existing stocks in the \n.\n On 6 September, Wagner reportedly deployed a convoy of more than 100 vehicles carrying weapons to the RSF garrison in \n from Chad.\n SAF deputy commander Lieutenant General \n also accused the Wagner Group of bringing in mercenaries from Chad, Mali, Niger, the Central African Republic, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Ethiopia, and Libya to fight alongside the RSF.\n\n\nIn response to these allegations, Russian Foreign Minister \n defended the possible involvement of the Wagner Group, saying that Sudan had the right to use its services.\n The head of the Wagner Group, \n, denied supporting the RSF, saying that the company has not had a presence in Sudan for more than two years.\n The RSF denied allegations that Wagner Group was supporting them, instead stating that the SAF was seeking such support.\n Sudan has denied the presence of Wagner on its territory.\n\n\nOn 7 June 2023, Hissein Alamine Tchaw-tchaw, a Chadian dissident who belongs to the same ethnic group as Hemedti and claiming to be the leader of the Movement for the Fight of the Oppressed in Chad (MFOC), which is fighting the government of President \n, posted a video showing his participation in an RSF attack on the Yarmouk munitions factory in Khartoum.\n\n\nOn 17 November, the SLM-Minnawi and the \n (JEM) accused the Chadian government of supporting the RSF, and \"supplying it with military equipment and mercenaries by opening its territory and airspace.\"\n A report from \n alleged that Chadian soldiers belonging to a joint Chadian-Sudanese command under \n intercepted a shipment of military equipment intended for the RSF on its way from \n and gave it instead to the JEM, which the latter denied.\n \n linked Chad's junta receiving financial support from the UAE in exchange for allowing it to support the RSF through Amdjarass airport.\n\n\nFollowing accusations by SAF deputy commander Yasser al-Atta of Chadian government support for the RSF, the Chadian government unsuccessfully demanded an apology from the Sudanese ambassador and expelled four Sudanese diplomats from the country on 17 December.\n\n\nThe SAF rejected Kenya's involvement in mediation efforts to end the conflict in July after al-Burhan accused President \n of having a business relationship with Hemedti and providing a haven to the RSF.\n In response to proposals for a peacekeeping force composed by African countries to be deployed in Sudan made in an \n (IGAD) committee chaired by Ruto, the SAF's Assistant Commander-in-Chief Lieutenant General Yasir Alatta accused Ruto of being a mercenary of another country, whom he did not identify, and dared Ruto to deploy the \n and that of his alleged backer.\n On 7 September, the Sudanese government threatened to withdraw the country's membership in IGAD unless Ruto was removed as chairman of the mediation committee.\n\n\nIn response, Kenyan Foreign Secretary Abraham Korir Sing'oei called these allegations \"baseless\",\n while the \n insisted on the country's neutrality in the conflict.\n\n\nA hacking group calling itself \n launched cyberattacks on \n and private websites in the last week of July.\n\n\nOn 19 September, \n reported that it was \"likely\" that \n \n were behind a series of drone strikes and a ground operation which was directed against the Wagner-backed RSF near Khartoum on 8 September.\n \n, chief of the \n, stated in an interview on 22 September that he could neither deny nor confirm the involvement of Ukraine in the conflict in Sudan,\n but said that Ukraine would punish Russian war criminals anywhere in the world.\n\n\nOn 6 November, the \n released drone footage of what it claimed was \n attacking Wagner mercenaries in an unidentified urban area in Sudan with an explosive projectile, which was believed to have been taken about two weeks before its publication.\n On 30 January 2024, the \n reported that Ukrainian special forces had launched three drone strikes targeting the Wagner Group and other Russian forces in Sudan as well as their local partners in the preceding weeks.\n The \n released a report on 5 February 2024 with video showing the aftermath of an attack by Ukrainian special forces on a Wagner Group unit that had suffered several deaths and the capture of at least one member seen being interrogated on camera.\n\n\nDespite longtime frosty relations between the Sudanese government and \n, the Iranian government gave military and political support to the SAF. Most prominently, the Iranian government has supplied \n drones to the SAF, which are viewed by journalist Wim Zwijnenburg as a major tactical boon for the Armed Forces.\n The drones were later credited with the SAF's success in retaking the Sudanese state media company's headquarters from the RSF in March 2024.\n Iran's support for the SAF was viewed by analyst Jihad Mashamoun as being motivated by a desire to gain access to the \n, as well as an attempt to undermine the United Arab Emirates' support for the RSF.\n Senior Sudanese government officials denied receiving such aid from Iran.\n On 10 April, Reuters reported that according to a senior Sudanese army officer and to six unidentified Iranian sources that Iranian-made drones had helped the army push back the RSF, whose press office confirmed, without providing evidence, that this fit with their intelligence.  Multiple cargo flights in December 2023 and January 2024 from Iran to Port Sudan have been identified by Zwijnenburg.\n\n\nThe outbreak of violence has led foreign governments to monitor the situation in Sudan and move toward the evacuation and repatriation of their nationals. Among some countries with a number of expatriates in Sudan are \n, which has more than 10,000 citizens in the country,\n and the United States, which has more than 16,000 citizens, most of whom are \n.\n Efforts at extraction were hampered by the fighting within the capital Khartoum, particularly in and around the airport. This has forced evacuations to be undertaken by road via \n on the \n, which lies about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of Khartoum.\n from where they were airlifted or ferried directly to their home countries or to third ones. Other evacuations were undertaken through overland border crossings or airlifts from diplomatic missions and other designated locations with direct involvement of the militaries of some home countries. Some transit hubs used during the evacuation include the port of \n in Saudi Arabia and \n, which hosts military bases of the United States, China, Japan, France, and other European countries.\n\n\nThe repeated violations of the \n and other atrocities during the conflict led to U.S. President \n issuing an executive order on 4 May 2023 authorizing sanctions for those deemed responsible for destabilizing Sudan, undermining the democratic transition and committing human rights abuses.\n On 1 June, the US government imposed its first sanctions related to the conflict, targeting two firms associated with the SAF and two others linked to the RSF. It also imposed visa restrictions against individuals involved in the violence, but did not divulge any names.\n\n\nOn 6 September, the \n and the \n imposed sanctions on the RSF's deputy commander and Hemedti's brother \n, and \n, the RSF's top commander in West Darfur, over \"extensive\" human rights violations during the conflict, with Jumma in particular being accused of masterminding the assassination of the state's governor Khamis Abakar in June.\n On 28 September, it sanctioned former foreign minister and leader of the \n \n, the Sudan-based GSK Advance Company Ltd, and the Russia-based military company Aviatrade LLC, accusing Karti and other Islamist hardliners of obstructing efforts toward a ceasefire and accusing the firms of supporting the RSF.\n\n\nOn 4 December, the State Department imposed sanctions on three former officials of the Bashir regime, namely former minister and presidential aide Taha Osman Ahmed al-Hussein and former directors of the Sudanese National Intelligence and Security Services Salah Abdallah Mohamed Salah aka Sala Gosh and Mohamed Etta Elmoula Abbas, citing Al-Hussein's involvement in coordinating with regional actors to support the RSF, Gosh's plotting to overthrow the civilian-led transitional government, and Elmoula's attempts to restore the Bashir regime to power.\n\n\nOn 12 July 2023, the \n announced sanctions on firms linked to the SAF and the RSF for providing funds and weapons in the conflict.\n On 15 April 2024, \n imposed sanctions on two individuals and four entities linked to the SAF and the RSF.\n\n\nThe humanitarian crisis following the fighting was further exacerbated by the violence occurring during a period of high temperatures, drought and it starting during the fasting month of \n. Civilians were unable to venture outside of their homes to obtain food and supplies for fear of getting caught in the crossfire. A doctors' group said that hospitals remained understaffed and were running low on supplies as wounded people streamed in.\n The World Health Organization recorded around 26 attacks on healthcare facilities, some of which resulted in casualties among medical workers and civilians.\n The \n said 80% of hospitals in conflict areas were out of service\n with 32 forcibly evacuated by soldiers or caught in the crossfire.\n This included about half of Khartoum's 130 medical facilities and all hospitals in West Darfur.\n Outbreaks of diseases such as \n, \n and \n were reported across the country.\n\n\nIn April 2023, the United Nations reported that shortages of basic goods, such as food, water, medicines and fuel have become \"extremely acute\".\n The delivery of badly-needed remittances from overseas migrant workers was also halted after \n announced in the same month that it was closing all operations in Sudan until further notice.\n The World Food Programme said that more than $13 million worth of food aid destined for Sudan had been looted in the twenty days since the fighting broke out.\n  The looting of the WFP's warehouses in El-Obeid on 1 June led to the loss of food aid meant to feed 4.4 million people.\n  An estimated 25 million people, equivalent to more than half of Sudan's population, were said to be in need of aid in June 2023.\n On 25 July, Humanitarian Coordinator Clementine Nkweta-Salami said attacks on humanitarian facilities had led to more than 50 warehouses looted, 82 offices ransacked, and over 200 vehicles stolen.\n \n\nIn September 2023, the \n said that 1,200 children had died from disease outbreaks in refugee camps in \n since May.\n In \n, the head of the Hamidiya refugee camp said at least 43 children had died in the camp since July.\n UNICEF also estimated that the conflict had led to the number of children being out of school in Sudan to rise from seven million prior to the fighting to 19 million in October 2023.\n By 2024, the war's economic costs had surpassed all prior armed conflicts since Sudanese independence in 1956 due to extensive destruction of infrastructure, particularly in urban areas such as the capital city of \n.\n\n\nThe \n released a report on 22 February 2024 saying that more than 95% of Sudan's population could not afford a meal a day.\n The dramatic decrease in agricultural activity (\"cereal production in 2023 was nearly halved\") caused increases in food prices, and the conflict led to infrequent aid convoys.   According to an army official cited by \n as of 29 March 2024 \"70 aid trucks have been stuck in North Kordofan since October\". The UN estimated that 25 million people still needed aid, with 5 million facing famine and 18 million enduring \"acute food insecurity\".  Mobile networks being cut for nearly two months compounded the problems for those being helped by remittances from relatives abroad.\n According to the United Nations, both the SAF and RSF are posing obstacles to food aid because they want to prevent food from getting to areas controlled by the other.\n\n\nAs of 21 March 2024, at least 8.5 million residents of Sudan have been displaced due to the fighting. The United Nations said that the conflict had produced more than 6.5 million \n, while more than two million had fled the country altogether.\n This has made Sudan the largest host of IDPs globally.\n The International Organization for Migration estimated that around 69% of IDPs had come from the Khartoum region.\n In November, the UN said the conflict had created the largest child displacement crisis in the world, affecting three million children.\n\n\nOf those who fled abroad, more than 160,000 of them were \n who fled to Chad to escape ethnically based attacks by the RSF and allied militias.\n Fighting between the SAF and the SPLM-N (al-Hilu) had reportedly displaced more than 35,000 people in Blue Nile State alone, with 3,000 of them fleeing to Ethiopia,\n while more than 83,000 were displaced in South Kordofan.\n As of August, more than 400,000 people had fled to Chad, making it the largest single destination of refugees from the conflict, while others fled to other neighboring countries such as the Central African Republic, Egypt, and South Sudan.\n\n\nCriticism was levelled at diplomatic missions operating in Sudan for their slow response in helping Sudanese visa applicants whose passports were left behind in embassies following their closure during evacuation efforts, preventing them from leaving the country.\n\n\nThe UN estimated that economic activity in Sudan fell by more than a third during the first three weeks of the conflict.\n In July, Sudanese economists estimated the total amount of damage brought by the conflict at $9 billion, or an average of $100 million per day, while the value of property and goods looted was estimated at another $40 billion, with the most affected areas being Khartoum and South Darfur.\n The exchange rate of the US dollar against the \n in the black market rose to SDG730 in September, while it reached SDG625 at the official rate. This later reached SDG1250 in February 2024. The formal economy was described as being in a \"near standstill\".\n Gold production was also reduced to just two tons from the previous year's output of 18 tons.\n Sudanese minister for minerals \n accused the RSF of looting around 15 tons of silver and 1,273 kilograms of gold from the Sudan Gold Refinery at the start of the conflict.\n\n\nIn February 2024, finance minister \n said that the Sudanese economy had contracted by 40 percent in 2023 due to the fighting, with an additional decline of 28 percent expected in 2024. He added that state revenues had also decreased by 80 percent.\n Sudanese port authorities estimated that international trade had fallen by 23 percent in 2023. The Sudanese finance ministry was unable to set a national budget for 2023 or 2024 and stopped issuing quarterly reports. It also raised the exchange rate for imports and exports from SDG650 to SDG950. The fighting also rendered more than 60 percent of Sudan's agricultural land out of service, according to Fikra for Studies and Development.\n\n\nBoth the SAF and the RSF are accused of committing war crimes,\n with the RSF being singled out by the \n,\n and the United Kingdom\n and United States\n governments for committing \n.\n\nOn 13 July 2023, the office of the \n's Chief Prosecutor \n said that it had launched investigations into possible war crimes and crimes against humanity committed during the course of the 2023 conflict, within the context of \n, which started in 2005 based on \n.\n The \n (UNSC)  resolution limits the investigation to Darfur.\n On 5 September, UN Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide \n acknowledged that the conflict and related abuses had \"strong identity-based components.\"\n In an interview by the BBC, Burhan said that he would cooperate with the ICC to bring those responsible to justice.\n In his report to the UNSC on 29 January 202, he expressed that there are \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that crimes outlined in the \"\n\" are currently taking place in the \"unstable western region\".\n\n\nOn 3 August, \n released its report on the conflict. Titled \n, it documented \"mass civilian casualties in both deliberate and indiscriminate attacks\" by both the SAF and the RSF, particularly in Khartoum and West Darfur. It also detailed sexual violence against women and girls as young as 12, targeted attacks on civilian facilities such as hospitals and churches, and looting.\n\n\nOn 6 September, the \n and the \n imposed sanctions on the RSF's deputy commander and Hemedti's brother \n, and \n, the RSF's top commander in West Darfur, over  \"extensive\" human rights violations during the conflict, with Jumma in particular being accused of masterminding the assassination of the state's governor \n in June.\n \n, United States Secretary of State, accused the RSF ethnic cleansing in December 2023.\n\n\nThe SAF accused the RSF of perpetrating war crimes.\n On 4 August, General \n, as chair of the \n, established a committee tasked with investigating war crimes, human rights violations, and other crimes attributed to the RSF.\n The committee was to be chaired by a representative of the \n, and also included officials from the Foreign and Justice Ministries, the SAF, the Police, the General Intelligence Service, and the National Commission for Human Rights.\n During his speech to the UN General Assembly in New York in September, al-Burhan called for the international community to designate the RSF as a \"terrorist group\".\n\n\nIn September, the United States, Britain, Norway, and Germany planned to propose a motion to the UN Human Rights Council for an investigation into the alleged atrocities in Sudan. The draft motion, which condemns the human rights violations during the conflict, aimed to establish a three-person Fact Finding Mission to investigate these allegations. The experts would document the violations and provide updates to the 47-member Council. The draft has been circulated among member countries but has not yet been formally submitted to the Council.\n On 11 October, the \n voted 19–16 with 12 abstentions to adopt a resolution creating a fact-finding committee on crimes and violations in Sudan since the start of the conflict.\n\n\n (HRW) has called for robust measures to address the ongoing atrocities, urging the United States to take action at the UN Security Council to protect civilians and hold those responsible for the violence accountable.\n The \n (UNITAMS) has expressed grave concern over the targeting of civilians and public facilities by the RSF and allied militias, and the need for urgent action to ensure the safety and protection of civilians in Darfur.\n\n\nDuring the conflict, several instances of disinformation were observed, which aimed to manipulate public opinion, spread false narratives, and create confusion. Both the SAF and the RSF engaged in disinformation campaigns on social media platforms.\n The RSF heavily relied on tweets and inauthentic behavior to spread its agenda and influence local and international opinions. On the other hand, the Sudanese army used Twitter to refute RSF claims and boost army morale with false victory claims.\n The RSF had dedicated teams based in Khartoum and Dubai to engage in a digital propaganda war. They used social media, including officially verified Facebook and Twitter accounts, to showcase their activities and spread disinformation.\n\n\nVarious misleading videos were shared on social media platforms, falsely depicting scenes of violence in the ongoing fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces. Some videos were taken from other conflicts or events, misattributed to the current crisis in Sudan.\n Some viral images on social media were unrelated or misleadingly attributed to the ongoing fighting in Sudan.\n\n\nOn 14 April, the official SAF social media page published a video which it said was of operations carried out by the Sudanese Air Force against the RSF. Al Jazeera's monitoring and verification unit claimed the video had been fabricated using footage from the video game \n that was published on \n in March 2023. The unit claimed the video showing Sudanese army commander Abdel Fattah al-Burhan inspecting the Armoured Corps, in \n, was from before the fighting. A video reportedly of helicopters flying over Khartoum to participate in operations by the SAF against the RSF, which circulated on social media, turned out to be from November 2022.\n\n\nTwo photos circulated on social media that depicted a burning bridge reported as Bahri bridge and a bombed building allegedly in Khartoum, were both revealed to be from the \n.\n\n\nIn April, a video supposedly showing the RSF in control of \n on 15 April circulated on social media. The fact-checking website \n found that the video had appeared online 3 months prior to the conflict.\n A video posted in June and taken by an RSF soldier showing purported victims of the Bashir regime turned out to have been that of mummies and human remains used as props from the M. Bolheim Bioarchaeology Laboratory in Khartoum, which were thought to date from 3300 to 3000 BCE.\n\n\nOn 5 May, the British newspaper \n reported that the RSF had sent \"special bulletins\" to UK politicians, which it claimed were to combat \"the disproportionate amount of \n\" about the conflict. The bulletins were created with the assistance of Capital Tap Holdings, a \n-based investment firm which has mining interests in Sudan. The \n reported that the RSF's Facebook page was being run jointly from UAE and Sudan, and its \n account appeared to be based in \n, with the RSF saying its media team was based in Khartoum.\n\n\nIn June, a picture of \n hospitalised in \n, Kenya, was circulated in the social media and reported by the Turkish \n.\n News websites Fatabyyano and Juhainah checked the images and found it to be fabricated with the original image which belonged to \n, who was killed in the United States in 2019.\n Also in June, dominant social media account holders supporting the SAF attacked the \n, accusing the organization of being partial toward the RSF and collaborating with the so-called \"Janjaweed\" militia. These false accusations endangered the reputation and safety of the medical professionals.\n\n\nFootage of an SAF warplane reportedly shot down by the RSF in Khartoum on 20 September was found to be that of an \n fighter jet that crashed in \n,\n while a video showing an \n warplane reportedly shot down by the RSF while on a mission in northern Sudan was found to be that of a Libyan aircraft taken outside Sudan in 2020.\n\n\nOn 11 August, Facebook shut down the main pages of the RSF due to a violation of its policy, \"Dangerous Organizations and Individuals\". In an alternate account, the RSF accused the SAF of lodging complaints based on false reports that led to the removal of its pages and said it was in contact with Facebook's parent company \n to restore them.\n\n\nKyle Walter of \n, a British disinformation analysis firm, said in May: \"What's most concerning from this latest example of potential foreign interference is that it provides a look into how the nature of these threats are evolving, particularly in the context of the rapid onset of \n being used to create fake images and text. Although we don't know if this so-called sophisticated 'special bulletin' was created by this technology, it is symbolic of the wider issue at hand: an inability to trust what you're seeing, reading, and the undermining of the entire information landscape.\"\n\n\nFormer Prime Minister \n publicly appealed to both al-Burhan and Hemedti to cease fighting.\n\n\nOn 18 April, el-Wasig el-Bereir of the \n said he was in communication with the SAF and the RSF to get them to stop fighting immediately,\n while el-Fateh Hussein of the \n called for the fighting to stop immediately, stating that the resistance committees had long called for the SAF to \"return to their barracks\" and for the RSF to be dissolved.\n\n\n coordinated medical support networks, sprayed antiwar messages on walls, and encouraged local communities to avoid siding with either the RSF or the SAF. Hamid Murtada, a member of the resistance committees, described the resistance committees as having \"an important role in raising awareness to their constituencies and in supporting initiatives that [would] end the war immediately\".\n\n\nOn 22 and 23 April, protests against the conflict were held by residents in Khartoum North, \n, and \n.\n On 30 July, different groups in Kadugli organized marches against the violence in South Kordofan, some of whom supported the SAF, while others condemned the SAF, the RSF and the SPLM-N (al-Hilu).\n\n\nOn 25 July, following a meeting in \n, four Sudanese political groupings, namely the \n, the National Movement Forces, the National Accord Forces, and the \n, called on al-Burhan to form \"a caretaker government\" as soon as possible to rule the country during the war and promote dialogue.\n\n\nOn 30 July, nurses of the Port Sudan Teaching Hospital Emergency Department went on strike in protest over the non-payment of salaries since the beginning of the conflict, forcing the closure of the hospital since then after other departments joined.\n\n\nIn response to calls by SPLM-N faction leader and Transitional Sovereignty Council Deputy Chair \n to support the SAF, the \n called on upon \"the tribes and people of Sudan to resist calls for recruiting their youth to favour either of the warring parties\" in a statement released on 6 August. Other political groups such as the Forces for Freedom and Change-Central Council and the \n also expressed their rejection of the conflict and said on 7 August that they had positioned themselves \"equidistant\" from both the SAF and the RSF.\n\n\nOn 19 April 2023, diplomatic missions in Sudan, which included those of \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, the \n, the \n, and the \n (\n, \n, \n, the \n, \n, \n, and \n), issued a joint statement calling for fighting parties to observe their obligations under international law, specifically urging them to \"protect civilians, diplomats and humanitarian actors,\" avoid further escalations and initiate talks to \"resolve outstanding issues\".\n\n\nMany countries condemned the violence and called on the warring sides to cease fighting and resume the \n,\n while Egypt, South Sudan and Israel offered to mediate between the SAF and the RSF.\n Several of Sudan's neighbors, including \n, \n and \n closed their border with Sudan,\n while Eritrea said it would not establish refugee camps for those crossing its border from Sudan.\n\n\nInternational organizations also echoed demands for an end to the fighting and the restoration of civilian government.\n\n\nIn late 2023 and in 2024, diplomats were named specifically to deal with the crisis by the U.S. (\n),\n the U.N. (\n),\n the African Union (\n),\n and the IGAD (Lawrence Korbandy).\n\n\nA call for a Ramadan truce initiated by the UN, the US, the African Union, and the League of Arab States was initially praised by al-Burhan but was subsequently criticised by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\n\nIn an op-ed published on 8 April 2024, \n foreign policy chief \n called upon the two belligerents to cease the deliberate delay of food and aid convoys and to negotiate. He announced a conference in Paris on 15 April 2024 to raise humanitarian aid and call for a ceasefire. After identifying what he termed \"external sponsors\"—such as the UAE, Iran, and Russia—as providing financing and arms which were exacerbating the conflict,  he added that \"the genocidal atrocities against civilians based on their ethnicity that put Sudan in the headlines in 2003 have resumed\",  and called upon the UAE to use its leverage with the RSF to help end the war.\n\n\nRenewed negotiations are scheduled to begin in Jeddah on 18 April 2024 amid hopes that external actors who have historically backed the RSF (UAE) and the SAF (Egypt) will be present. However, talks currently in progress in Cairo (also involving Egypt and the UAE) are thought to be in competition with the planned Jeddah summit. Meanwhile, Djibouti's president \n is reportedly trying to convince al-Burhan to return to the \n.\n\n\nIn his March 2024 article \"How (Not) to Talk About the War in Sudan\" political scientist Gerrit Kurz of the \n (German \n: SWP) cautioned against misguided analysis and oversimplification of the reasons and warring parties. In his analysis of international reports and political statements, he named \"three misconceptions about the origin, dynamics, and impact of the conflict. These biased views concern the lack of international attention, the role of the security sector and the interference of external actors.\" Stressing the importance of how international commentators present the political dimension of this war, Kurtz described often neglected and complex interrelations between these three central aspects and wider implications. In particular, he advised commentators to call the war an “ignored conflict\" rather than a \"forgotten conflict\", and a \"war between the main armies and their allies at the expense of the civilian population\", instead of a \"war between two generals\". Further, he drew attention to the various factors of \"external influence\", for example by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt or Lybia involved in what is often simply called a \"proxy war\".\n \n"},

In June 2023, Ukraine launched \n in the southeast, which by the end of the year had petered out with only small amounts of territory retaken.\n\nThe invasion was met with \n. The \n passed \n condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal in March 2022. The \n ordered Russia to suspend military operations and the \n expelled Russia.

The \n (ICC) opened \n into possible \n, \n, \n, and \n. The ICC issued four \n in that regard: \n in March 2023, alleging responsibility for the unlawful deportation of children, as well as for commanders \n and \n in 2024, for alleged war crimes.\n\n\nIn return for security guarantees, Ukraine signed the \n in 1994, agreeing to dismantle the \n the former \n had left in Ukraine.\n At that time, Russia, the UK, and the USA agreed in the \n to uphold Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n In 1999, Russia signed the \n, affirming the right of each state \"to choose or change its security arrangements\" and join alliances.\n In 2002, Putin said that Ukraine's growing relations with \n were no concern of Russia.\n\n\nHowever, when Ukraine and \n sought to join NATO in 2008, Putin warned that their membership would be a threat to Russia.\n Some NATO members worried about antagonising Russia.\n At the \n, NATO refused to offer Ukraine and Georgia membership, but \n, Secretary General of NATO, also issued a statement that they would join one day.\n Russian foreign minister \n said Russia would do everything it could to prevent this.\n Putin claimed that NATO members had promised in 1990 not to let Eastern European countries join. No such provision was included in any treaty signed by Russia or NATO.\n In 2010, former Soviet leader \n clarified that there was never any promise to not enlarge the NATO alliance.\n (\n)\n\nIn 2013, \n overwhelmingly approved finalising an \n with the \n (EU).\n Russia had put pressure on Ukraine to reject it.\n Kremlin adviser \n warned in September 2013 that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement, Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine's borders.\n In November, Ukrainian president \n suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement,\n choosing closer ties to the Russian-led \n instead. This coerced withdrawal triggered a wave of protests known as \n, culminating in the \n in February 2014. Yanukovych was removed from power by parliament and fled to Russia.\n\nSince 23 February 2014 \n followed in eastern and southern Ukraine. \n occupied the Ukrainian territory of Crimea, and \n.\n Russia \n in March 2014, after a \n. The \n began in April 2014 when \n seized Ukrainian government buildings and proclaimed the independent \n and \n.\n Russian troops were directly involved in these conflicts.\n The ceasefires of the \n, signed in September 2014 and February 2015 in a bid to stop the fighting, repeatedly failed.\n A dispute emerged over the role of Russia: \n members France, Germany, and Ukraine saw Minsk as an agreement between Russia and Ukraine, but Russia insisted Ukraine should negotiate directly with the two separatist republics.\n\n\nThe annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas sparked a wave of \n and \n, with calls to annex more Ukrainian land for \n (New Russia).\n Analyst \n called Putin's 2014 speech following the annexation a \"manifesto of \n\".\n Putin utilised the \n and \n as a justification for his involvement in the annexation of Crimea and the war in Donbas.\n\n\nFinally, on 23 December 2014 (i.e. after the Russian annexation of Crimea), the Ukrainian parliament voted to remove the neutrality clause from the \n and to actively seek Ukraine's membership in \n.\n\n\nThere was a massive Russian military build-up near the Ukraine border in March and April 2021,\n and again in both Russia and Belarus from October 2021 onward.\n Members of the Russian government repeatedly denied having plans to invade or attack Ukraine, with denials being issued up to the day before the invasion.\n The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of \n or \n in Putin's inner circle, including national security adviser \n and \n \n.\n\n\nIn July 2021, Putin published an essay \"\n\", in which he called Ukraine \"historically Russian lands\" and claimed there is \"no historical basis\" for the \"idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians\".\n Days before the invasion, Putin claimed that Ukraine never had \"real statehood\" and that modern Ukraine was a mistake created by the \n.\n American historian \n described Putin's ideas as \n.\n British journalist \n described it as \n. Other observers found that Russia's leadership held a distorted view of Ukraine, as well as of its own history,\n and that these distortions were propagated through the state.\n\n\nDuring the second build-up, Russia demanded that NATO end all activity in Eastern Europe and ban Ukraine or any \n from ever joining NATO.\n Russia threatened an unspecified military response if NATO followed an \"aggressive line.\"\n These demands were widely seen as non-viable; Eastern European states have willingly joined NATO for security reasons, and their governments sought protection from Russian irredentism.\n A treaty to prevent Ukraine joining would go against NATO's \"\n\" policy, despite NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join.\n NATO Secretary General \n replied that \"Russia has no say\" on whether Ukraine joins, and that \"Russia has no right to establish a \n to try to control their neighbours.\"\n NATO's official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, and \n had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea.\n NATO offered to improve communication with Russia to discuss missile placements and \n, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's borders,\n but Russia did not do so.\n\nFrench President \n and German Chancellor \n both made efforts in February 2022 to prevent war.\n Macron met Putin but failed to dissuade him from the invasion. Scholz warned Putin heavy sanctions would be imposed should he invade, and told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a \n and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted to uphold such a settlement.\n Ukraine had been a neutral country in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea and \n.\n On 19 February, Zelenskyy made a speech at the \n, calling for Western powers to drop their policy of \"\n\" towards Moscow and implement a clear time-frame for when Ukraine could join NATO.\n\n\nOn 21 February, Putin \n Russian diplomatic recognition of the Russian-controlled territories of Ukraine as independent states: the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as \"peacekeepers\",\n and the \n authorised the use of military force abroad.\n\n\nBefore 5 a.m. Kyiv time on 24 February, Putin in another speech \n, a \"\n\", which \"effectively declar[ed] war on Ukraine.\"\n Putin said the operation was to \"protect the people\" of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He \n that they had \"been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime.\"\n Putin also \n that Ukrainian government officials were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and that NATO was building up military infrastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia.\n He said Russia sought the \n, and espoused views challenging Ukraine's right to exist.\n Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to \n.\n Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,\n and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south.\n Russia did not officially declare war.\n Reports of an alleged leak of Russian \n (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.\n\n\nThe strength of Russian invading forces, including Russia-controlled \"people's militias\" of DPR and LPR, is estimated at 190,000 personnel. The strength of Russian forces fighting at 24 February 2024 is estimated at 500,000.\n\n\nThe invasion, described as the biggest attack on a European country since the Second World War, began at dawn on 24 February.\n Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air campaign, commencing air and missile strikes across Ukraine,\n with some rockets reaching as far west as \n.\n It is Russia's largest \n operation since the \n in 1945.\n Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time near \n on the border with Russia.\n The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards \n and \n.\n Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white \n (a non-\n), believed to be a measure to prevent \n.\n\n\nImmediately after the invasion began, Zelenskyy declared \n.\n The same evening, he ordered a \n of all Ukrainian males between 18 and 60 years old,\n prohibiting them from leaving the country.\n \n mercenaries and \n contracted by the Kremlin reportedly made \n, including an operation involving several hundred mercenaries meant to infiltrate Kyiv with the aim of killing the Ukrainian president.\n The Ukrainian government said anti-war officials within Russia's \n shared the plans with them.\n\n\nThe Russian invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce Ukrainian resistance.\n In Kyiv, Russia failed to take the city and was repulsed in the battles of \n, \n, and \n. The Russians tried to encircle the capital, but its defenders under \n held their ground, effectively using Western \n and \n to thin Russian supply lines and stall the offensive.\n\n\nOn the southern front, Russian forces had captured the regional capital of \n by 2 March. A column of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles was \n on 9 March in \n and sustained heavy losses that forced them to retreat.\n The Russian army adopted \n on the western front around the key cities of Chernihiv, Sumy and Kharkiv, but failed to capture them due to stiff resistance and logistical setbacks.\n In \n, Russian forces advanced as far as \n, but were repelled and pushed back south of Mykolaiv. On 25 March, the \n stated that the first stage of the \"military operation\" in Ukraine was \"generally complete\", that the Ukrainian military forces had suffered serious losses, and the Russian military would now concentrate on the \"liberation of \n.\"\n The \"first stage\" of the invasion was conducted on four fronts, including one towards western \n from Belarus by the Russian \n, comprising the \n, \n, and \n. A second axis, deployed towards eastern Kyiv from Russia by the \n (northeastern front), comprised the \n and the \n.\n\n\nA third axis was deployed towards Kharkiv by the \n (eastern front), with the \n and \n. A fourth, southern front originating in occupied Crimea and Russia's \n with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward \n was opened by the \n, including the \n, \n, and \n, the latter also commanding the 1st and 2nd Army Corps of the \n.\n By 7 April, Russian troops deployed to the northern front by the Russian Eastern Military District pulled back from the Kyiv offensive, reportedly to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas region in an effort to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern Ukraine. The northeastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for resupply and redeployment to southeastern Ukraine.\n On 26 April, delegates from the US and 40 allied nations \n in Germany to discuss the formation of \n that would provide economic support in addition to military supplies and refitting to Ukraine.\n Following Putin's \n speech in early May, US Director of National Intelligence \n said no short term resolution to the invasion should be expected.\n\n\nUkraine's reliance on Western-supplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness, as supplying countries feared that Ukraine would use Western-made matériel to strike targets in Russia.\n Military experts disagreed on the future of the conflict; some suggested that Ukraine should trade territory for peace,\n while others believed that Ukraine could maintain its resistance due to Russian losses.\n\n\nBy 30 May, disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent, with Ukrainian artillery being vastly outgunned, in terms of both range and number.\n In response to \n \n's indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine, Putin said that Russia would expand its invasion front to include new cities in Ukraine. In apparent retribution, Putin ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on 6 June after not directly attacking the city for several weeks.\n On 10 June 2022, deputy head of the \n Vadym Skibitsky stated that during the Severodonetsk campaign, the frontlines were where the future of the invasion would be decided: \"This is an artillery war now, and we are losing in terms of artillery. Everything now depends on what [the west] gives us. Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10% of what they have.\"\n\n\nOn 29 June, \n reported that US Intelligence Director Avril Haines, in an update of past U.S. intelligence assessments on the Russian invasion, said that U.S. intelligence agencies agree that the invasion will continue \"for an extended period of time ... In short, the picture remains pretty grim and Russia's attitude toward the West is hardening.\"\n On 5 July, \n reported that extensive destruction by the Russian invasion would cause immense financial damage to Ukraine's reconstruction economy, with Ukrainian Prime Minister \n telling nations at a reconstruction conference in Switzerland that Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost.\n\n\nThe invasion began on 24 February, launched out of Belarus to target Kyiv, and from the northeast against the city of Kharkiv. The southeastern front was conducted as two separate spearheads, from Crimea and the southeast against Luhansk and Donetsk.\n\nRussian efforts to capture Kyiv included a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the \n. The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack from Russia along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at \n, and from the east at \n. These were likely intended to encircle Kyiv from the northeast and east.\n\n\nRussia tried to seize Kyiv quickly, with \n infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but failed.\n The United States contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee the country, lest the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing Kyiv; Zelenskyy responded that \"The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.\"\n \n, which described the quote as \"one of the most-cited lines of the Russian invasion\", was not entirely sure of the comment's accuracy. Reporter \n said it came from \"a single source, but on the surface it appears to be a good one.\"\n Russian forces advancing on Kyiv from Belarus \n of the ghost town of \n.\n \n attempted to seize two key airfields near Kyiv, launching an \n,\n and a similar \n, near \n, on 26 February.\n\n\nBy early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences.\n As of 5 March, \n, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) long, had made little progress toward Kyiv.\n The London-based \n \n (RUSI) assessed Russian advances from the north and east as \"stalled.\"\n Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a \n. Russian forces continued to advance on Kyiv from the northwest, capturing \n, \n, and \n by 5 March,\n though \n remained contested as of 9 March.\n By 11 March, the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover.\n On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive to repel Russian forces.\n Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched their strategy to \n and \n warfare.\n\nOn 25 March, a Ukrainian counter-offensive retook several towns to the east and west of Kyiv, including \n.\n Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north at the end of March. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April.\n Ukraine said it had recaptured the entire region around Kyiv, including Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel, and uncovered evidence of \n in \n.\n On 6 April, NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said that the Russian \"retraction, resupply, and redeployment\" of their troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin's plans for Ukraine, by redeploying and concentrating his forces on eastern Ukraine.\n Kyiv was generally left free from attack apart from isolated missile strikes. One did occur while UN Secretary-General \n was \n on 28 April to discuss the survivors of the siege of Mariupol with Zelenskyy. One person was killed and several were injured in the attack.\n\n\nRussian forces advanced into \n on 24 February and besieged its administrative capital. The next day \n.\n \n into \n the same day attacked the city of \n, just 35 kilometres (22 mi) from the Russo-Ukrainian border.

Troops used \n to destroy the \n across the river, allowing Crimea to obtain water from the \n, which had been cut off since 2014.\n On 26 February, the \n began as the attack moved east linking to separatist-held Donbas.\n En route, Russian forces entered \n and \n.\n On 1 March, Russian forces \n \n and nearby cities.\n On 25 February, Russian units from the DPR were fighting near \n as they moved on Mariupol.\n By evening, the \n began an \n on the coast of the \n 70 kilometres (43 mi) west of Mariupol. A US defence official said that Russian forces were deploying thousands of \n from this \n.\n\n\nThe \n approached the \n on 26 February\n and \n.

Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said that the Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the renewed ultimatum to surrender and to fight to the last soul.\n On 20 April, Putin said that the siege of Mariupol could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the Azovstal iron works and estimated 1,000 Ukrainian civilians were completely sealed off from any type of relief.\n\n\nAfter consecutive meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, UN Secretary-General Guterres on 28 April said he would attempt to organise an emergency evacuation of survivors from Azovstal in accordance with assurances he had received from Putin on his visit to the Kremlin.\n On 30 April, Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection.\n By 3 May, after allowing approximately 100 Ukrainian civilians to depart from the Azovstal steel factory, Russian troops renewed their bombardment of the steel factory.\n On 6 May, \n reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining Ukrainian soldiers, who had lost contact with the Kyiv government; in his last communications, Zelenskyy authorised the commander of the besieged steel factory to surrender as necessary under the pressure of increased Russian attacks.\n On 7 May, the \n reported that all civilians were evacuated from the Azovstal steel works at the end of the three-day ceasefire.\n\n\nAfter the last civilians evacuated from the Azovstal bunkers, nearly two thousand Ukrainian soldiers remained barricaded there, 700 of them injured. They were able to communicate a plea for a military corridor to evacuate, as they expected summary execution if they surrendered to Russian forces.\n Reports of dissent within the Ukrainian troops at Azovstal were reported by \n on 8 May indicating that the commander of the \n assigned to defend the Azovstal bunkers made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks, munitions, and personnel, broke out from the position there and fled. The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defensive position in Azovstal as a result, which allowed progress to advancing Russian lines of attack.\n \n, deputy commander of the remaining Ukrainian troops barricaded at Azovstal, said: \"We are basically here dead men. Most of us know this and it's why we fight so fearlessly.\"\n\n\nOn 16 May, the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had \"fulfilled its combat mission\" and that final evacuations from the Azovstal steel factory had begun. The military said that 264 service members were evacuated to Olenivka under Russian control, while 53 of them who were \"seriously injured\" had been taken to a hospital in \n also controlled by Russian forces.\n Following the evacuation of Ukrainian personnel from Azovstal, Russian and DPR forces fully controlled all areas of Mariupol. The end of the battle also brought an end to the Siege of Mariupol. Russia press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Russian President Vladimir Putin had guaranteed that the fighters who surrendered would be treated \"in accordance with international standards\" while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an address that \"the work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy—and time.\" Some prominent Russian lawmakers called on the government to deny prisoner exchanges for members of the \n.\n\n\nA Russian missile attack on \n in the city of Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, reportedly killing at least 52 people\n and injuring as many as 87 to 300.\n On 11 April, Zelenskyy said that Ukraine expected a major new Russian offensive in the east.\n American officials said that Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere in Ukraine, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment of infantry and tank divisions to the southeastern Ukraine front.\n Military satellites photographed extensive Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment of its northeastern troops to the southeastern front of the invasion.\n\n\nOn 18 April, with Mariupol almost entirely overtaken by Russian forces, the Ukrainian government announced that the second phase of the reinforced invasion of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions had intensified with expanded invasion forces occupying of the Donbas.\n\n\nOn 22 May, the BBC reported that after the fall of Mariupol, Russia had intensified offensives in Luhansk and Donetsk while concentrating missile attacks and intense artillery fire on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk province.\n\n\nOn 23 May, Russian forces were reported entering the city of \n, fully capturing the city by 26 May.\n Ukrainian forces were reported leaving \n.\n By 24 May, Russian forces captured the city of \n.\n On 30 May, Reuters reported that Russian troops had breached the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.\n By 2 June, \n reported that Sievierodonetsk was on the brink of capitulation to Russian occupation with over 80 per cent of the city in the hands of Russian troops.\n On 3 June, Ukrainian forces reportedly began a counter-attack in Sievierodonetsk.

As many as 500 Russian soldiers controlled the plant; Kyiv's nuclear agency said they were shelling nearby areas and storing weapons and \"missile systems\" there. Almost the entire country went on air raid alert. \"They already shell the other side of the river Dnipro and the territory of Nikopol,\" Energoatom president Pedro Kotin said.\n Russia agreed on 19 August to allow IAEA inspectors access to the Zaporizhzhia plant after a phone call from Macron to Putin. As of July 2023, however, access to the plant remained limited and required extensive negotiation.\n\n\nRussia reported that 12 attacks with explosions from 50 artillery shells had been recorded by 18 August at the plant and the company town of \n.\n \n, chair of the UK's \n, said on 19 August that any deliberate damage to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant that could cause radiation leaks would be a breach of \n, under which an attack on a member state of NATO is an attack on them all. US congressman \n said the following day that any radiation leak would kill people in NATO countries, an automatic activation of Article 5.\n\n\nShelling hit \n dumps at the \n on 23 August, and the ash was on fire on 25 August. The 750 \n transmission line to the Dniprovska substation, the only one of the four 750 kV transmission lines still undamaged and cut by military action, passes over the ash dumps. At 12:12 p.m. on 25 August, the line was cut off due to the fire, disconnecting the plant and its two operating reactors from the national grid for the first time since its startup in 1985. In response, \n and \n for reactor 5 started up, and reactor 6 reduced generation.\n\n\nIncoming power was still available across the 330 kV line to the substation at the coal-fired station, so the diesel generators were not essential for cooling reactor cores and \n. The 750 kV line and reactor 6 resumed operation at 12:29 p.m., but the line was cut by fire again two hours later. The line, but not the reactors, resumed operation again later that day.\n On 26 August, one reactor restarted in the afternoon and another in the evening, resuming electricity supplies to the grid.\n On 29 August 2022, an IAEA team led by Rafael Grossi went to the plant to investigate.\n \n and \n were also on the team. No leaks had been reported at the plant before their arrival, but shelling had occurred days before.\n\n\nOn 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise \n, beginning near \n, led by \n.\n An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for \n to say that it dented the image of a \"Mighty Putin\". Kiev sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive.\n On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced \n and Minister of Defence \n said 300,000 reservists would be called.\n He also said that his country would use \"all means\" to \"defend itself.\" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable and that it was an attempt to justify \"Russia's failures.\"\n British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an \"escalation\",\n while former Mongolian president \n accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as \"cannon fodder.\"\n\n\nIn late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised \n on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine. These included the Donetsk People's Republic and the Luhansk People's Republic in Russian occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Denounced by Ukraine's government and its allies as \n, the elections' official results showed overwhelming majorities in favour of annexation.\n\n\nOn 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions in an address to both houses of the \n.\n Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all denounced the annexation as illegal.\n\n\nAn \n delegation visited the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant on 3 September, and on 6 September reported damage and security threats caused by external shelling and the presence of occupying troops in the plant.\n On 11 September, at 3:14 a.m., the sixth and final reactor was disconnected from the grid, \"completely stopping\" the plant. \n said that preparations were \"underway for its cooling and transfer to a cold state.\"\n\n\nIn the early hours of 9 October 2022, Russian Armed Forces \n in Zaporizhzhia, killing 13 civilians and injuring 89 others.\n\n\nOn 29 August, Zelenskyy advisedly vowed the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast. He first announced a counteroffensive to retake Russian-occupied territory in the south concentrating on the Kherson-Mykolaiv region, a claim that was corroborated by the Ukrainian parliament as well as \n.\n\n\nOn 4 September, Zelenskyy announced the liberation of two unnamed villages in Kherson Oblast and one in Donetsk Oblast. Ukrainian authorities released a photo showing the raising of the Ukrainian flag in \n by Ukrainian forces.\n Ukrainian attacks also continued along the southern frontline, though reports about territorial changes were largely unverifiable.\n On 12 September, Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces had retaken a total of 6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) from Russia, in both the south and the east. The BBC stated that it could not verify these claims.\n\n\nIn October, Ukrainian forces pushed further south towards the city of Kherson, taking control of 1,170 square kilometres (450 sq mi) of territory, with fighting extending to \n.\n On 9 November, defence minister Shoigu ordered Russian forces to leave part of Kherson Oblast, including the city of \n, and move to the eastern bank of the Dnieper.\n On 11 November, Ukrainian troops entered Kherson, as Russia completed its withdrawal. This meant that Russian forces no longer had a foothold on the west (right) bank of the Dnieper.\n\n\nUkrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv region near \n led by General Syrskyi.\n By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi). Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there.\n On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of \n.\n Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north.\n\n\nOn 9 September, the \n announced it would \"evacuate\" the civilian populations of Izium, Kupiansk and \n. The \n (ISW) said it believed Kupiansk would likely fall in the next 72 hours,\n while Russian reserve units were sent to the area by both road and helicopter.\n On the morning of 10 September, photos emerged claiming to depict Ukrainian troops raising the Ukrainian flag in the centre of Kupiansk,\n and the ISW said Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2,500 square kilometres (970 sq mi) by effectively exploiting their breakthrough.\n Later in the day, \n reported that Russian positions in northeast Ukraine had \"collapsed\" in the face of the Ukrainian assault, with Russian forces forced to withdraw from their base at Izium after being cut off by the capture of Kupiansk.\n\n\nBy 15 September, an assessment by \n's \n confirmed that Russia had either lost or withdrawn from almost all of their positions west of the \n. The retreating units had also abandoned various high-value military assets.\n The offensive continued pushing east and by 2 October, Ukrainian Armed Forces had liberated another key city in the \n.\n\n\nAfter the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter,\n with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline.\n Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in \"disappointment\" for Moscow, with limited gains as the offensive stalled.\n Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia's lack of \"trained men\", and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems.\n Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that \"after Russia's abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position.\"\n\n\nOn 7 February, \n reported that Russians had newly mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers to participate in the offensive in the Donbas, against Ukraine troops already wearied by previous fighting.\n The Russian private military company Wagner Group took on greater prominence in the war,\n leading \"grinding advances\" in \n with tens of thousands of recruits from \n taking part in \"near suicidal\" assaults on Ukrainian positions.\n\n\nIn late January 2023, fighting intensified in the southern Zaporizhzhia region, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\n In nearby southern parts of Donetsk Oblast, an \n near the coal-mining town of \n was called the largest \n battle of the war to date, and ended in disaster for Russian forces, who lost \"at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers\" according to Ukrainian commanders. The \n stated that \"a whole Russian brigade was effectively annihilated.\"\n\n\nFollowing defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces have focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that has prevailed there since the start of the war. Russian forces have sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via \n. After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces \n on 16 January 2023.\n By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from \n to the west.\n\n\nOn 3 March 2023, Ukrainian soldiers destroyed two key bridges, creating the possibility for a controlled fighting withdrawal from eastern sectors of Bakhmut.\n On 4 March, Bakhmut's deputy mayor told news services that there was street fighting in the city.\n On 7 March, despite the city's near-encirclement, \n reported that Ukrainian commanders were requesting permission from Kyiv to continue fighting against the Russians in Bakhmut.\n\n\nOn 26 March, Wagner Group forces claimed to have fully captured the tactically significant Azom factory in Bakhmut.\n Appearing before the \n on 29 March, General \n, \n, reported that, \"for about the last 20, 21 days, the Russia have not made any progress whatsoever in and around Bakhmut.\" Milley described the severe casualties being inflicted upon the Russian forces there as a \"slaughter-fest.\"\n\n\nBy the beginning of May, the ISW assessed that Ukraine controlled only 1.89 square kilometres (0.73 sq mi) of the city, less than five percent.\n On 18 May 2023, \n reported that Ukrainian forces had launched a local counteroffensive, taking back swathes of territory to the north and south of Bakhmut over the course of a few days.\n\n\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian forces gradually launched a series of counteroffensives on multiple fronts, including Donetsk Oblast, Zaporizhzhia Oblast, and others.\n On 8 June 2023, counteroffensive efforts focused near settlements such as \n, \n, and Bakhmut.\n However, counteroffensive operations have faced stiff resistance from Russia,\n and the American think tank \n called the Russian defensive effort as having \"an uncharacteristic degree of coherency.\"\n By 12 June, Ukraine reported its fastest advance in seven months, claiming to have liberated several villages and advanced a total of 6.5 km. Russian military bloggers also reported that Ukraine had taken \n, \n and \n, and were continuing to push southward.\n Ukraine continued to liberate settlements over the next few months, raising the Ukrainian flag over the settlement of \n in late August.\n\n\nOn 24 June, the Wagner Group \n against the Russian government, capturing several cities in western Russia largely unopposed before marching towards Moscow.\n This came as the culmination of \n between Wagner and the Russian Ministry of Defence.\n After about 24 hours, the Wagner Group backed down\n and agreed to a peace deal in which Wagner leader \n would go into exile in Belarus, and his forces would be free from prosecution.\n On 27 June, the UK's Ministry of Defence reported that Ukraine were \"highly likely\" to have reclaimed territory in the eastern Donbas region occupied by Russia since 2014 among its advances. Pro-Russian bloggers also reported that Ukrainian forces had made gains in the southern Kherson region, establishing a foothold on the left bank of the Dnipro river after crossing it.\n\n\nIn August, \n reported that Ukraine had become the most mined country in the world, with Russia laying millions of mines attempting to thwart Ukraine's counteroffensive. The vast minefields forced Ukraine to extensively de-mine areas to allow advances. Ukrainian officials reported shortages of men and equipment as Ukrainian soldiers unearth five mines for every square metre in certain places.\n\n\nFollowing Russia pulling out of the \n, the conflict on the Black Sea escalated with Ukraine targeting Russian ships. On 4 August, Ukrainian security service sources reported that the \n had been hit and damaged by an unmanned \n. Video footage released by Ukraine's security services appeared to show the drone striking the ship, with another video showing the ship seemingly listing to one side.\n On 12 September, both Ukrainian and Russian sources reported that Russian naval targets in Sevastopol had been struck by unconfirmed weaponry, damaging two military vessels, one of them reportedly a submarine.\n Ukraine also reported that \n on the Black Sea held by Russia since 2015 had been retaken.\n\n\nIn September 2023, \n estimated that Russia had deployed over 420,000 troops in Ukraine.\n\n\nOn 21 September, Russia began missile strikes across Ukraine, damaging the country's energy facilities.\n On 22 September, the US announced it would send long-range \n missiles to Ukraine,\n despite the reservations of some government officials.\n The same day, the \n launched a \n on the \n headquarters in Sevastopol, Crimea, killing several senior military officials.\n\n\nIn October 2023, it was reported that there was a growth of mutinies among Russian troops due to large amount of losses in Russian offensives around \n with a lack of artillery, food, water and poor command also being reported.\n By November, British intelligence said that recent weeks had \"likely seen some of the highest Russian casualty rates of the war so far.\"\n\n\nIn mid-to-late October 2023, Ukrainian marines—partly guided by defecting Russian troops—crossed the \n (the strategic barrier between eastern and western Ukraine), downstream of the destroyed \n, to attack the Russian-held territory on the east side of the river. Despite heavy losses due to intense Russian shelling and aerial bombardment, disorganisation, and dwindling resources, Ukrainian brigades invading the Russian-held side of the river continued to inflict heavy casualties on Russian forces well into late December.\n\n\nOn 1 December 2023, Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Ukrainian counter-offensive was not successful, citing slower than expected results.\n Zelenskyy also stated that it will be easier for Ukraine to regain the Crimean peninsula than the Donbas region in the east of the country, because the Donbas is heavily militarised and there are frequent pro-Russian sentiments.\n In December 2023, multiple international media outlets described the Ukrainian counteroffensive as having failed to regain any significant amount of territory or meet any of its strategic objectives.\n\n\nOn 26 December, using \n, Ukraine's air force attacked the \n, a large \n docked in \n, which Ukraine said launched cruise missiles upon Ukrainian cities. Ukraine's attack caused multiple explosions and fires. Ukraine said the attack detonated munitions on the ship, and it was destroyed—unlikely to sail again. Russian authorities confirmed the attack, but not the loss, and said two attacking aircraft were destroyed. Independent analysts said the ship's loss could hamper future Russian attacks on Ukraine's coast.\n\n\nOn 31 January 2024, Ukrainian sea drones struck the Russian \n Ivanovets in the Black Sea, causing the ship to sink.\n Two weeks later on 14 February, the same type of Ukrainian sea drones struck and sank the \n.\n\n\nOn 17 February 2024, \n, a longtime stronghold for Ukraine that had been described as a \"gateway\" to nearby \n.\n ABC News stated that Russia could use the development to boost morale with the war largely at a stalemate close to its second anniversary.\n Described by \n as a pyrrhic Russian victory, the Russian 2nd and 41st Combined Arms Armies ended up with 16,000 men killed, tens of thousands wounded and around 700 vehicles lost before seizing the ruins of Avdiivka.\n \n, a prominent pro-war Russian blogger, reportedly died by suicide following a post revealing the large number of Russian casualties during the battle.\n\n\nUkraine's shortage of ammunition caused by political deadlock in the U.S. Congress and a lack of production capacity in Europe contributed to the Ukrainian withdrawal from Avdiivka, and was ″being felt across the front″ according to \n. The shortage resulted in Ukraine having to ration its units to fire only 2,000 rounds per day, compared to an estimated 10,000 rounds fired daily by Russia.\n\n\nOn 29 February, the Ukrainian Air Force reported a spree of shooting down 11 Russian jets in 11 days: eight \n, two \n fighters and a rare \n radar plane.\n\n\nThe supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders.\n\n\nUS general \n said that Ukraine's top military commander in the war, \n, General \n, \"has emerged as the military mind his country needed. His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians.\"\n Russia began the invasion with no overall commander. The commanders of the four military districts were each responsible for their own offensives.\n\n\nAfter initial setbacks, the commander of the Russian Southern Military District, \n, was placed in overall command on 8 April 2022,\n while still responsible for his own campaign. Russian forces benefited from the centralisation of command under Dvornikov,\n but continued failures to meet expectations in Moscow led to multiple changes in overall command:\n\n\nRussia has suffered a remarkably large number of casualties in the ranks of its officers, including 12 \n.\n\n\nAerial warfare began the first day of the invasion. Dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both eastern and western Ukraine,\n reaching as far west as Lviv.\n\n\nBy September, the Ukrainian air force had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.\n In mid-October, Russian forces launched \n, intended to knock out energy facilities.\n By late November, hundreds of civilians had been killed or wounded in the attacks,\n and \n had left millions without power.\n\n\nIn December, drones launched from Ukraine allegedly carried out several attacks on \n and \n air bases in \n, killing 10 and heavily damaging two \n aircraft.\n\n\n\n\nOn 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian \n headquarters in Sevastopol.\n On 9 August 2022, \n were reported at \n in western Crimea. Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed. Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident;\n Ukrainian general \n claimed responsibility on 7 September.\n\n\nThe base is near \n, a destination popular with tourists. Traffic backed up at the Crimean Bridge after the explosions with queues of civilians trying to leave the area.\n A week later Russia blamed \"sabotage\" for explosions and a fire at an arms depot near \n in northeastern Crimea that also damaged a railway line and power station. Russian regional head \n said that 2,000 people were evacuated from the area.\n On 18 August, explosions were reported at \n north of Sevastopol.\n On the morning of 8 October 2022, the \n linking occupied Crimea to Russia, \n.\n On 17 July 2023, there was \n on the bridge.\n\n\nRussia has carried out waves of strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems.\n\nOn 15 November 2022, Russia fired 85 missiles at the Ukrainian power grid, causing major power outages in Kyiv and neighboring regions.\n On 31 December, Putin in his New Year address called the war against Ukraine a \"sacred duty to our ancestors and descendants\" as missiles and drones rained down on Kiev.\n\n\nOn 10 March 2023, \n reported that Russia had used new hypersonic missiles in a massive missile attack on Ukraine. Such missiles are more effective in evading conventional Ukrainian anti-missile defences that had previously proved useful against Russia's conventional, non-hypersonic missile systems.\n\n\nUkraine lies on the \n, which has ocean access only through the Turkish-held \n and \n straits. On 28 February, Turkey invoked the 1936 \n and sealed off the straits to Russian warships that were not registered to Black Sea home bases and returning to their ports of origin. It specifically denied passage through the \n to four Russian naval vessels.\n On 24 February, the \n announced that Russian Navy ships had begun an \n.\n The guided missile cruiser \n and patrol boat \n bombarded the island with deck guns.\n The Russian warship identified itself and instructed the Ukrainians on the island to surrender. Their response was \"\n\"\n After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of \n.\n Russia said on 26 February that US drones had supplied intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help it target Russian warships in the Black Sea. The US denied this.\n\n\nBy 3 March, Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv \n the frigate \n, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, to prevent its capture by Russian forces.\n On 14 March, the Russian source RT reported that the Russian Armed Forces had captured about a dozen Ukrainian ships in Berdiansk, including the \n \n.\n On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian \n docked in Berdiansk—initially reported to be the \n and then its sister ship, the \n—was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.\n In March 2022, the UN \n (IMO) sought to create a safe sea corridor for commercial vessels to leave Ukrainian ports.\n On 27 March, Russia established a sea corridor 80 miles (130 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide through its \n, for the transit of merchant vessels from the edge of Ukrainian territorial waters southeast of Odesa.\n Ukraine closed its ports at \n level 3, with sea mines laid in port approaches, until the end to hostilities.\n\n\nThe Russian cruiser \n, the flagship of the \n, was, according to Ukrainian sources and a US senior official,\n hit on 13 April by two Ukrainian \n, setting the ship afire. The Russian Defence Ministry said the warship had suffered serious damage from a munition explosion caused by a fire, and that its entire crew had been evacuated.\n Pentagon spokesman John Kirby reported on 14 April that satellite images showed that the Russian warship had suffered a sizeable explosion onboard but was heading to the east for expected repairs and refitting in \n.\n Later the same day, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that the \n while under tow in rough weather.\n On 15 April, Reuters reported that Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory \n in Kyiv where the Neptune missiles used in the \n attack were manufactured and designed.\n On 5 May, a US official confirmed that the US gave \"a range of intelligence\" (including real-time battlefield \n \n)\n to assist in the sinking of the \n.\n\n\nIn early May, Ukrainian forces launched counterattacks on Snake Island. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed to have repelled these counterattacks. Ukraine released footage of a Russian \n being destroyed in the Black Sea near Snake Island by a Ukrainian drone.\n The same day, a pair of Ukrainian \n conducted a high-speed, low level \n on Russian-occupied Snake Island; the attack was captured on film by a \n drone.\n On 1 June, Russian Foreign Minister \n asserted that Ukraine's policy of mining its own harbours to impede Russia maritime aggression had contributed to the food export crisis, saying: \"If Kyiv solves the problem of demining ports, the Russian Navy will ensure the unimpeded passage of ships with grain to the Mediterranean Sea.\"\n On 30 June 2022, Russia announced that it had withdrawn its troops from the island in a \"gesture of goodwill.\"\n The withdrawal was later confirmed by Ukraine.\n\n\nFour days into the invasion, President Putin placed Russia's nuclear forces on high alert, raising fears that Russia could use \n against Ukraine, or a wider escalation of the conflict could occur.\n Putin alluded in April to the use of nuclear weapons, and Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said there was a \"real\" danger of a World War III.\n On 14 April 2022, CIA director \n said that \"potential desperation\" in the face of defeat could encourage President Putin to use tactical nuclear weapons.\n In response to Russia's disregard of safety precautions during its occupation of the disabled former \n and its firing of missiles in the vicinity of the active \n, Zelenskyy called on 26 April for an international discussion on Russia's use of nuclear resources, saying: \"no one in the world can feel safe knowing how many nuclear facilities, nuclear weapons and related technologies the Russian state has ... If Russia has forgotten what Chernobyl is, it means that global control over Russia's nuclear facilities, and nuclear technology is needed.\"\n\n\nIn August 2022, shelling around Zaporizhzhia power plant became a crisis, prompting an emergency inspection by the IAEA. Ukraine described the crisis \n by Russia.\n On 19 September, President Biden warned of a \"consequential response from the U.S.\" if Russia were to resort to using nuclear weapons in the conflict.\n Before the United Nations on 21 September Biden criticised Putin's nuclear \n, calling Putin was \"overt, reckless and irresponsible... \n.\"\n In March 2023, Putin announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n\n\nUkrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defence units, making \n, donating food, building barriers like \n,\n and helping to transport refugees.\n Responding to a call from \n, Ukraine's transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs,\n constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways.\n Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.\n By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country. The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence.\n\n\nPeople physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat.\n The Russian soldiers' response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters,\n to firing into the air, to firing directly into crowds.\n There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media has reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, \n, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military.\n To facilitate Ukrainian attacks, civilians reported Russian military positions via a \n \n and \n, a Ukrainian government app previously used by citizens to upload official identity and medical documents. In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killed a civilian who had pictures of Russian tanks.\n\n\nAs of 21 May 2022, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine had 700,000 service members on active duty fighting the Russian invasion.\n Ukraine withdrew soldiers and military equipment back to Ukraine over the course of 2022 that had been deployed to \n missions like \n in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\n\nThe invasion received widespread international condemnation from \n.\n On 2 March 2022 and on 23 February 2023, 141 \n of the \n voted for a resolution saying that Russia should immediately withdraw. Seven, including Russia, voted against the measure.\n Political reactions to the invasion included \n, which triggered \n.\n Sanctions forced Russia to reorient its oil exports to non-sanctioning countries such as India, rely more on \n (which was not subject to European Union sanctions), and shift its coal exports to from Europe to Asia.\n Most European countries cancelled nuclear cooperation with Russia.\n\n\nOver seventy sovereign states and the European Union delivered \n to Ukraine, and nearly fifty countries plus the EU provided \n.\n Economic sanctions included a ban on Russian aircraft using EU airspace,\n a \n, and a ban on certain Russian media outlets.\n Reactions to the invasion have included public response, media responses, \n, and the examination of the \n.\n\nThe invasion received widespread international public condemnation. Some countries, particularly in the \n, saw public sympathy or outright support for Russia, due in part to distrust of \n.\n Protests and demonstrations were held worldwide, including some \n and \n.\n Calls for \n spread on social media platforms,\n while hackers attacked Russian websites, particularly those operated by the Russian government.\n \n against Russians living abroad surged after the invasion.\n In March 2022, Russian President Putin introduced \n for publishing \"fake news\" about Russian military operations,\n intended to suppress any criticism related to the war.\n\n\nAccording to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2023, 31 percent of the world's population live in countries that are leaning towards or supportive of Russia, 30.7 percent live in neutral countries, and 36.2 percent live in countries that are against Russia in some way.\n\n\nBy October 2022, three countries—Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia—had declared Russia a \"terrorist state.\"\n On 1 August, \n became the first European country to close its embassy in Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\nThe invasion prompted Ukraine,\n \n and \n to officially apply for NATO membership.\n Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023,\n followed by Sweden on 7 March 2024.\n\n\nA documentary film produced during the siege of Mariupol, \n, won the \n in 2024.\n\n\nThe \n tracked $155.9 billion from 41 countries and European Union institutions in financial, humanitarian, and military aid to Ukraine from 24 January 2022 to 24 February 2023.\n NATO is coordinating and helping member states to provide billions of dollars in military equipment and financial aid to Ukraine.\n The Kiel Institute tracked $380 billion in aid to Ukraine from January 2022 to 15 January 2024, including nearly $118 billion in direct military aid from individual countries.\n\n\nThe United States has provided the most military assistance,\n having committed over $46.3 billion from 24 February 2022 to 15 January 2024.\n Many NATO allies, including Germany, have reversed past policies against providing offensive military aid in order to support Ukraine. The European Union, for the first time in its history, supplied lethal arms, and has provided €3.1 billion to Ukraine.\n Bulgaria, a major manufacturer of Soviet-pattern weapons, has covertly supplied more than €2 billion worth of arms and ammunition to Ukraine, including a third of the ammunition needed by the Ukrainian military in the critical early phase of the invasion; Bulgaria also provides fuel supplies and has, at times, covered 40% of the fuel needed by the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\n\nForeign involvement in the invasion has been worldwide and extensive, with support ranging from foreign military sales and aid, foreign military involvement, foreign sanctions and ramifications, and including foreign condemnation and protest.\n The US adopted a policy of \"no boots on the ground\" in Ukraine.\n Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia for recognising the separatist people's republics as independent nations. When the attack began, many countries applied new sanctions intended to cripple the Russian economy.\n The sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, bank transfers, exports, and imports.\n The \n set up the \n for victims to seek compensation for damages caused by Russia during the invasion.\n\n\nBelarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage part of the invasion, and to launch Russian missiles into Ukraine.\n\n\n reported in March 2023 that \n state-owned weapons manufacturer \n shipped assault rifles, drone parts, and body armor to Russia between June and December 2022, with some shipments via third countries including \n and the \n.\n According to the United States, Chinese ammunition has been used on battlefields in Ukraine.\n In May 2023, the European Union identified that Chinese and UAE firms were supplying weapon components to Russia.\n\n\nIn June 2023, US military intel suggested \n was providing both \n and production materials to develop a \n to Russia.\n\n\nOn 21 September 2023, Poland said it would cease sending arms to Ukraine after a dispute between the two countries over grain.\n\n\nAccording to the US, North Korea has supplied Russia with ballistic missiles and launchers although US authorities did not mention the specific models. Based on debris left by missiles on 30 December 2023 attacks against Ukrainian targets show parts common to KN-23, KN-24 and KN-25 missiles.\n\n\nIn February 2024, a \n report indicated that Iran sent ballistic missiles to the Russian military.\n In April 2024, China was reported to have supplied Russia with \n, machine tools for tanks, and propellants for missiles.\n\n\nRussian and Ukrainian sources have both been said to inflate the casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for the sake of morale.\n Leaked US documents say that \"under-reporting of casualties within the [Russian] system highlights the military's 'continuing reluctance' to convey bad news up the chain of command.\"\n Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll.\n Russia and Ukraine have admitted suffering \"significant\"\n and \"considerable\" losses, respectively.\n \n has reported that Ukrainian reports of Russian casualty figures included the injured.\n\n\nThe numbers of civilian and military deaths have been as always \n precisely.\n \n (AFP) reported that neither it nor independent conflict monitors were able to verify Russian and Ukrainian claims of enemy losses and suspected that they were inflated.\n On 12 October 2022, the independent Russian media project \n, citing sources close to the Kremlin, reported that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, seriously wounded, or gone missing in Ukraine.\n\n\nWhile combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources including \n of military action, civilian deaths can be more difficult. On 16 June 2022, the \n told CNN that he believed that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had died, adding that he hoped that the total death toll was below 100,000.\n In the destroyed city of Mariupol alone, Ukrainian officials believe that at least 25,000 have been killed,\n and bodies were still being discovered in September 2022.\n The mayor said over 10,000 and possibly as many as 20,000 civilians died in the siege of Mariupol and that Russian forces had brought mobile cremation equipment with them when they entered the city.\n Researcher Dan Ciuriak from \n in August 2022 estimates the number of killed Mariupol civilians at 25,000,\n and an investigation by \n from the end of 2022 gives a number of up to 75,000 killed civilians in Mariupol area alone.\n \n says that \"a key gap in casualty counts is the lack of information from Russian-occupied places like the port city of \n, where tens of thousands of civilians are believed to have died\".\n According to a recent study by Human Rights Watch and two other organizations, there were at least 8,034 excess deaths in Mariupol between March 2022 and February 2023.\n The \n (OHCHR) reports similar issues and believed that the true civilian casualty numbers were significantly higher than it has been able to confirm.\n\n\nOfficial and estimated numbers of \n (POW) have varied.\n On 24 February \n, Ukraine's ambassador to the US, said that a platoon of \n from \n had surrendered, saying they were unaware that they had been brought to Ukraine and tasked with killing Ukrainians.\n Russia claimed to have captured 572 Ukrainian soldiers by 2 March 2022,\n while Ukraine said it held 562 Russian soldiers as of 20 March.\n It also released one soldier for five of its own and exchanged another nine for the detained mayor of Melitopol.\n\n\nOn 24 March 2022, 10 Russian and 10 Ukrainian soldiers, as well as 11 Russians and 19 Ukrainian civilian sailors, were exchanged.\n On 1 April 86 Ukrainian servicemen were exchanged\n for an unknown number of Russian troops.\n \n on 9 June 2022 cited an intelligence estimate of more than 5,600 Ukrainian soldiers captured, while the Russian servicemen held prisoner fell from 900 in April to 550 after several prisoner exchanges.\n\nAn 25 August 2022 report by the Humanitarian Research Lab of the \n identified some 21 \n for Ukrainian \"civilians, POWs, and other personnel\" in the vicinity of Donetsk oblast. Imaging of one of these, \n, found two sites with disturbed earth consistent with \"potential graves.\"\n Kaveh Khoshnood, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said: \"Incommunicado detention of civilians is more than a violation of international humanitarian law—it represents a threat to the public health of those currently in the custody of Russia and its proxies.\" Conditions described by freed prisoners include exposure, insufficient access to sanitation, food and water, cramped conditions, electrical shocks and physical assault.\n\n\nIn late 2022, as Russian casualties exceeded 50,000, the Russian army introduced \n. The U.K. defence ministry stated that these are units that threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives. In March 2023, Russian soldiers filmed a video addressed to President Putin where they stated that after suffering casualties, they attempted to return to their headquarters but were denied evacuation by their superiors. They stated that barrier troops were placed behind them threatening to ″destroy them″.\n In particular, \n units have been reported to be ″kept in line″ by barrier troops.\n\n\nIn March 2023, UN human rights commissioner \n reported that more than 90% of the Ukrainian POWs interviewed by his office, which could only include those who were released from Russia, said in Russia \"they were tortured or ill-treated, notably in penitentiary facilities, including through so-called – it is an awful phrase – 'welcoming beatings' on their arrival, as well as frequent acts of torture throughout detention.\"\n\n\nIn April 2023, several videos started circulating on different websites purportedly showing Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers.\n Zelensky compared Russian soldiers to \"beasts\" after the footage was circulated.\n Russian officials opened an investigation of the footage shortly thereafter.\n\n\nDuring the invasion, the Russian military and authorities have been responsible for deliberate \n (including \n and \n), massacres of civilians, abduction and torture of civilians, \n,\n forced deportation of civilians, and torture and murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. They have also carried out many \n in densely-populated areas, including \n.\n\n\nAccording to the \n (OHCHR), by December 2023, about 78% of confirmed civilian casualties had been killed in Ukrainian-controlled territory, while  21% had been killed in Russian-occupied territory.\n\n\nRussian forces have reportedly used banned \n at least 465 times during the war, usually as \n grenades.\n The use of tear gas is banned by international \n and considered a chemical weapon if applied by military forces during warfare.\n On 6 April 2024, a \n investigation concluded that ″Russian troops are carrying out a systematic campaign of illegal chemical attacks against Ukrainian soldiers″.\n\n\nIn March 2024, the United Nations issued a report saying Russia may have executed more than 30 recently captured Ukrainian prisoners of war over the winter months. \n verified three incidents in which Russian servicemen executed seven Ukrainian servicemen. According to the same report, 39 of 60 released Ukrainian prisoners of war also \"disclosed that they had been subjected to sexual violence during their internment, including attempted rape, threats of rape and castration, beatings or the administration of electric shocks to genitals, and repeated forced nudity, including during interrogations and to check for tattoos.\"\n\n\nThe \n (ICC) opened \n into possible \n, \n and war crimes.\n On 17 March 2023 the ICC issued a warrant for Putin's arrest, charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the \n forcibly deported to Russia.\n It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a \n of the \n (the world's five principal nuclear powers).\n Moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes, a response Vittorio Bufacchi of University College in Cork says \"has bordered on the farcical,\"\n and its contention that the images coming out of Bucha were fabricated \"a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris, post-truth on overdrive, (that) does not merit to be taken seriously.\" Even the usually fractured United States Senate came together to call Putin a war criminal.\n One of several efforts to document Russian war crimes concerns its repeated bombardment of markets and bread lines, destruction of basic infrastructure and attacks on exports and supply convoys, in a country where deliberate starvation of Ukrainians by Soviets the \n still looms large in public memory.\n Forcible deportation of populations, such as took place in Mariupol, is another area of focus, since \"forced deportations and transfers are defined both as war crimes under the \n and \n and Article 8 of the Rome Statute—and as crimes against humanity—under Article 7 of the \n. As both war crimes and \n, they have several mechanisms for individual accountability, the International Criminal Court and also, at the individual state level, \n and \n legislation.\n\n\nThe humanitarian impact of the invasion has been extensive and has included negative impacts on international food supplies and the \n.\n An estimated 6.6 million Ukrainians were internally displaced by August 2022, and about the same number were refugees in other countries.\n The invasion has devastated the cultural heritage of Ukraine,\n with over 500 Ukrainian cultural heritage sites, including cultural centres, theatres, museums, and churches, affected by \"Russian aggression.\" Ukraine's \n called it \n.\n Deliberate destruction and looting of Ukrainian cultural heritage sites in this way is considered a \n.\n\n\nThe Russian attacks on civilians, causing mass civilian casualties and displacement, have been characterised as \n and \n.\n On 15 September 2023, a U.N.-mandated investigative body presented their findings that Russian occupiers had tortured Ukrainians so brutally that some of their victims died, and forced families to listen as they raped women next door.\n The commission has previously said that violations committed by Russian forces in Ukraine, including the use of torture, may constitute crimes against humanity.\n\n\nA report by Physicians for Human Rights described Russian violence against the Ukrainian health care system as being a prominent feature of Russia's conduct during the war, documenting 707 attacks on Ukraine's health care system between 24 February and 31 December 2022. Such attacks are considered war crimes.\n\n\nThe war caused the largest refugee and \n in Europe since the \n in the 1990s;\n the UN described it as the fastest growing such crisis since World War II.\n As Russia built up military forces along the Ukrainian border, many neighbouring governments and aid organisations prepared for a mass displacement event in the weeks before the invasion. In December 2021, the Ukrainian defence minister estimated that an invasion could force three to five million people to flee their homes.\n\n\nIn the first week of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine; this subsequently reached over eight million by 31 January 2023.\n On 20 May, NPR reported that, following a significant influx of foreign military equipment into Ukraine, a significant number of refugees are seeking to return to regions of Ukraine which are relatively isolated from the invasion front in southeastern Ukraine.\n However, by 3 May, another 8 million people were displaced inside Ukraine.\n\n\nMost refugees were women, children, elderly, or disabled.\n Most male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine as part of mandatory conscription,\n unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children, single fathers, or were the parent/guardian of children with disabilities.\n Many Ukrainian men, including teenagers, opted to remain in Ukraine voluntarily to join the resistance.\n\n\nAccording to the UN High Commission for Refugees as of 13 May 2022, there were 3,315,711 refugees in Poland, 901,696 in Romania, 594,664 in Hungary, 461,742 in Moldova, 415,402 in Slovakia, and 27,308 in Belarus, while Russia reported it had received over 800,104 refugees.\n By 13 July 2022, over 390,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in the Czech Republic, where the average refugee was a woman accompanied by one child. These refugees were twice as likely to have a college degree as the Czech population as a whole.\n Turkey has been another significant destination, registering more than 58,000 Ukrainian refugees as of 22 March, and more than 58,000 as of 25 April.\n The EU invoked the \n for the first time in its history, granting Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years.\n Britain has accepted 146,379 refugees, as well as extending the ability to remain in the UK for 3 years with broadly similar entitlements as the EU, three years residency and access to state welfare and services.\n\n\nAccording to the \n (OSCE), Russia has engaged in \"massive deportation\" of over 1.3 million Ukrainian civilians, potentially constituting crimes against humanity.\n The OSCE and Ukraine have accused Russia of \n civilians to filtration camps in Russian-held territory, and then into Russia. Ukrainian sources have compared this policy to \n and Russian actions in the \n.\n For instance, as of 8 April, Russia claimed to have evacuated about 121,000 Mariupol residents to Russia.\n Also, on 19 October, Russia announced the forced deportation of 60,000 civilians from areas around the line of contact in Kherson oblast.\n \n and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to various centres in cities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine,\n from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia.\n In April, Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council secretary \n said that Russia planned to build \"concentration camps\" for Ukrainians in western Siberia, and likely planned to force prisoners to build new cities in Siberia.\n\n\nBoth \n and \n faced the prospect of significant \n even before the war, having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration. It is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other.\n Russia had a fighting-age (18- to 40-year-old) male population more than four times higher than Ukraine's and slightly higher birth rates, while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine.\n\n\nSeveral sources have pointed out that the war is considerably worsening Ukraine's demographic crisis, making significant shrinking very likely.\n A July 2023 study by the \n stated that \"regardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation, Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war. Even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants, around 20% fewer than before the war (2021: 42.8 million) and the decline in the working-age population is likely to be the most severe and far-reaching.\" The study took different scenarios, from a \"best case\" (end of the war in 2023 without much further escalation) to a \"worst case\" (end of the war in 2025 with further escalation) into account. Flight from war affected especially the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of child-bearing age and their children. With an estimate of more than 20% of refugees not returning, study author Maryna Tverdostup concluded that long-term shrinking will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction.\n\n\nThe war in Ukraine and the associated emigration, lower \n and war-related casualties further deepened the \n.\n Many commentators predict that the situation will be worse than during the 1990s.\n The UN is projecting that the decline that started in 2021 will continue, and if current demographic conditions persist, Russia's population would be 120 million in fifty years, a decline of about 17%.\n\n\nSince February 2022, hundreds of thousands of Russians have \n; estimates range from 370,000 to over 820,000. Combined with mobilisation, this possibly removed roughly half a million to one million working-age males from Russia's population.\n Studies report that this will have a demographic effect, especially in Russia, that lasts much longer than the conflict, and Putin's time in office.\n\n\nAccording to BBC:\n\n\nThey come from different walks of life. Some are journalists like us, but there are also IT experts, designers, artists, academics, lawyers, doctors, PR specialists, and linguists. Most are under 50. Many share western liberal values and hope Russia will be a democratic country one day. Some are LGBTQ+. Sociologists studying the current Russian emigration say there is evidence that those leaving are younger, better educated and wealthier than those staying. More often they are from bigger cities.\nAccording to Johannes Wachs, \"The exodus of skilled human capital, sometimes called \n, out of Russia may have a significant effect on the course of the war and the Russian economy in the long run.\"\n According to a survey, around 15 percent of those who left returned to Russia, either permanently or to settle their affairs.\n\n\nIn November 2023, at the \n, Putin urged Russian women to have eight or more children amid increasing Russian casualties in the invasion.\n\n\nBased on a preliminary assessment, the war has inflicted \n 51 billion in environmental damage in Ukraine; according to a report by the \n, some 687,000 tons of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,600 tons of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water. Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 70 acres of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible.\n Around 30% of Ukraine's land is now littered with explosives and more than 2.4 million hectares of forest have been damaged.\n\n\nAccording to Netherlands-based peace organisation PAX, Russia's \"deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure\" has caused \"severe\" pollution, and the use of explosive weapons has left \"millions of tonnes\" of contaminated debris in cities and towns.\n In early June 2023, the \n, under Russian occupation, \n, causing flooding and triggering warnings of an \"ecological disaster.\"\n\n\nThe Ukrainian government, international observers and journalists have described the damage as \n.\n The Ukrainian government is investigating more crimes against the environment and ecocide (a crime in Ukraine).\n Zelenskyy has met with prominent European figures (\n, \n, \n and \n) to discuss the environmental damage and how to prosecute it.\n\n\nAccording to an investigation by NGL Media published in April 2024, Russia has completely destroyed over 60,000 hectares of Ukrainian forests. The investigation stated that long-term ecological consequences may include lowering of the groundwater level, reduction of biodiversity, worsening of air quality, fire outbreaks, and rivers and ponds drying up.\n\n\nOn April 27, 2024, it was reported that Russia was planning increases in personal income taxes and corporate taxes to help pay for the war.\n\n\nPeace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on \n, \n, and \n, in the \n on the \n, with further talks held on 10 March in Turkey and a fourth round of negotiations beginning 14 March.\n\n\nOn 13 July that year, Ukrainian foreign minister \n said that peace talks were frozen and Ukraine must first recover the lost territories in the east of the country before negotiations can begin.\n On 19 July, former Russian President and current Deputy head of the \n \n, said: \"Russia will achieve all its goals. There will be peace – on our terms.\"\n\n\nIn late September that year, after \n, Zelenskyy announced that Ukraine would not hold peace talks with Russia while Putin was president and in early October signed a decree to ban such talks.\n In late December that year, Putin's spokesperson \n and Russian Foreign Minister \n said that any peace plan could only proceed from Ukraine's recognition of Russia's sovereignty over the regions it annexed from Ukraine in September 2022.\n Ukraine counter proposal requires Moscow to returned the occupied Ukrainian territories and pay war damages.\n In January 2023, Putin's spokesperson Peskov said that \"there is currently no prospect for diplomatic means of settling the situation around Ukraine.\"\n\n\nIn May 2023, UN Secretary-General \n said peace negotiations to end the Russo-Ukrainian War were \"not possible at this moment\", saying it was clear that Russia and Ukraine were \"completely absorbed in this war\" and each \"convinced that they can win.\"\n\n\nIn June 2023, Ukrainian Defence Minister \n said that the peace plans presented by China, \n and \n are attempts at mediation on behalf of Russia, and \"they all currently want to be mediators on Russia's side. That's why this sort of mediation currently doesn't fit for us at all because they aren't impartial.\"\n He said that Ukraine was willing to accept China as a mediator only if Beijing could convince Russia to withdraw from all the \n.\n\n\nIn December 2023, \n reported that Putin has been signaling through intermediaries since at least September 2022 that \"he is open to a ceasefire that freezes the fighting along the current lines.\" This has been received with skepticism by Ukrainians and its supporters, with criticism that it could be an insincere, opportunistic public relations ploy by Russia that would give it time to rebuild its weakened army before renewing the offensive.\n Such concerns have been raised since 2022.\n\n"},

{"title": "Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\nSpanish victory\n\n \n\n puppets\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n, also known as the \n, was one of the most important campaigns in the \n. After years of preliminary exploration and military skirmishes, 168 \n soldiers under \n \n, along with his brothers in arms and their \n \n, captured the \n \n in the 1532 \n. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the \n. The conquest of the \n (called \"Tahuantinsuyu\"\n or \"Tawantinsuyu\"\n in \n, meaning \"Realm of the Four Parts\"),\n led to spin-off campaigns into present-day \n and \n, as well as expeditions to the \n and surrounding rainforest.\n\nWhen the Spanish arrived at the borders of the \n in 1528, it spanned a considerable area and was by far the largest of the four grand pre-Columbian civilizations. Extending southward from the Ancomayo, which is now known as the \n, in southern present-day \n to the \n in what would later be known as Chile, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the \n, it covered some of the most mountainous terrains on Earth. In less than a century, the Inca had expanded \n from about 400,000 km\n (150,000 sq mi) in 1448 to 1,800,000 km\n (690,000 sq mi) in 1528, just before the arrival of the Spanish. This vast area of land varied greatly in culture and climate. Because of the diverse cultures and geography, the Inca allowed many areas of the empire to be governed under the control of local leaders, who were watched and monitored by Inca officials. Under the administrative mechanisms established by the Inca, all parts of the empire answered to, and were ultimately under the direct control of, the Inca Emperor.\n Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire was more than 16,000,000.\n\n\nSome scholars, such as \n, believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline. In 1528, Emperor \n ruled the Inca Empire. He could trace his lineage back to a \"stranger king\" named \n, the mythical founder of the Inca clan,\n who, according to tradition, emerged from a cave in a region called \n.\n\nHuayna Capac was the son of the previous ruler, \n, and the grandson of \n, the Emperor who, by conquest, had commenced the dramatic expansion of the Inca Empire from its cultural and traditional base in the area around \n. On his accession to the throne, Huayna Capac had continued the policy of expansion by conquest, taking Inca armies north into what is today \n.\n While he had to put down a number of rebellions during his reign, by the time of his death, his legitimacy was as unquestioned as was the primacy of Inca power.\n\nExpansion had caused its own set of problems. Many parts of the empire retained distinct cultures, which were at best reluctant to become part of the greater imperial project. Due to its size, and the fact that all communication and travel had to take place by foot or by boat, the Inca Empire proved increasingly difficult to administer and govern, with the Inca Emperor having increasingly less influence over local areas.\n\nHuayna Capac relied on his sons to support his reign. While he had many legitimate-born of his sister-wife, under the Inca system- and illegitimate children, two sons are historically important. Prince Túpac Cusi Hualpa, also known as \n, was the son of Coya Mama Rahua Occllo of the royal line. The second was \n, an illegitimate son who was likely born of a daughter of the last independent King of \n, one of the states conquered by Huayna Capac during the expansion of the Inca Empire.\n These two sons would play pivotal roles in the final years of the Inca Empire.\n\nThe Spanish \n Pizarro and his men were greatly aided in their enterprise by invading when the Inca Empire was in the midst of a \n between the princes Huáscar and Atahualpa.\n Atahualpa seems to have spent more time with Huayna Capac during the years when he was in the north with the army conquering Ecuador. Atahualpa was thus closer to and had better relations with the army and its leading generals. When both Huayna Capac and his eldest son and designated heir, \n, died suddenly in 1528 from what was probably \n, a disease introduced by the Spanish into the Americas, the question of who would succeed as emperor was thrown open. Huayna had died before he could nominate the new heir.\n\nAt the time of Huayna Capac's death, Huáscar was in the capital Cuzco, while Atahualpa was in \n with the main body of the Inca army. Huáscar had himself proclaimed \n (i.e. \"Only Emperor\") in Cuzco, but the army declared loyalty to Atahualpa. The resulting dispute led to the \n.\n\n\nThe civil war between Atahualpa and Huascar weakened the empire immediately prior to its struggle with the Spanish. Historians are unsure if a united Inca Empire would have defeated the Spanish in the long term due to factors such as the high mortality from disease and the resulting social disruption, and the superior military technology of the conquistadors, who possessed horses, dogs, metal armor, swords, \n, and primitive, but effective, firearms.\n Atahualpa appeared to be more popular with the people than his brother, and he was certainly more valued by the army, the core of which was based in the recently conquered northern province of \n.\n\nAt the outset of the conflict, each brother controlled his respective domains, with Atahualpa secure in the north, and Huáscar controlling the capital of Cuzco and the large territory to the south, including the area around \n. This region had supplied large numbers of soldiers for Huáscar's forces. After a period of diplomatic posturing and jockeying for position, open warfare broke out. Huáscar seemed poised to bring the war to a rapid and decisive conclusion, as troops loyal to him took Atahualpa prisoner, while he was attending a festival in the city of \n. However, Atahualpa quickly escaped and returned to Quito. There, he was able to amass what is estimated to be at least 30,000 well-trained soldiers. While Huáscar managed to muster about the same number of soldiers, they were much less experienced.\n\nAtahualpa sent his forces south under the command of two of his leading generals, \n and \n, who won an uninterrupted series of victories against Huáscar that soon brought them to the very gates of \n. On the first day of the battle for Cuzco, the forces loyal to Huáscar gained an early advantage. However, on the second day, Huáscar personally led an ill-advised \"surprise\" attack, of which the generals Challcuchima and Quisquis had advanced knowledge. In the ensuing battle, Huáscar was captured, and resistance completely collapsed. The victorious generals sent word north by \n messenger to Atahualpa, who had moved south from Quito to the royal resort springs outside \n. The messenger arrived with news of the final victory on the same day\n that Pizarro and his small band of adventurers, together with some indigenous allies, descended from the Andes into the town of Cajamarca.\n\n and his brothers (\n, \n, and \n) were attracted by the rumors of a rich and fabulous kingdom. They had left the then-impoverished \n, like many migrants after them.\n\n\nThere lies Peru with its riches;\nHere, Panama and its poverty.\nChoose, each man, what best becomes a brave Castilian.\nIn 1529, Francisco Pizarro obtained permission from the Spanish Monarchy to conquer the land they called \n.\n\n\nAccording to historian \n, Peru is not a \n nor \n word, but Indo-European or hybrid. Unknown to Pizarro, as he was lobbying for permission to mount an expedition, his proposed enemy was being devastated by the \n during earlier Spanish contacts.\n\nWhen Pizarro arrived in Peru in 1532, he found it vastly different from when he had been there just five years before. Amid the ruins of the city of \n, he tried to piece together the situation before him. From two local boys, whom Pizarro had taught how to speak Spanish in order to translate for him, Pizarro learned of the civil war and of the disease that was destroying the Inca Empire.\n\n\nAfter four long expeditions, Pizarro established the first Spanish settlement in northern Peru, calling it \n.\n\n\nWhen first spotted by the natives, Pizarro and his men were thought to be \n or \"gods\". The Natives described Pizarro's men to the Inca. They said that \n was tall with a full beard and was completely wrapped in clothing. The Natives described the men's swords and how they killed sheep with them. The men did not eat human flesh, but rather sheep, lamb, duck, pigeons, and deer, and cooked the meat. Atahualpa was fearful of what the newly arrived white men were capable of. If they were \n or \"destroyers of peoples,\" then he should flee. If they were \n or \"gods who are benefactors of the people,\" then he should not flee, but welcome them.\n The messengers went back to Tangarala, and Atahualpa sent Cinquinchara, an Orejon warrior, to the Spanish to serve as an interpreter.\n\nAfter traveling with the Spanish, Cinquinchara returned to Atahualpa; they discussed whether or not the Spanish men were gods. Cinquinchara decided they were men because he saw them eat, drink, dress, and have relations with women. He saw them produce no miracles. Cinquinchara informed Atahualpa that they were small in number, about 170–180 men, and had bound the Native captives with \"iron ropes\". When Atahualpa asked what to do about the strangers, Cinquinchara advised that they be killed because they were evil thieves who would take whatever they wanted, and were \"\n or \"devils\". He recommended trapping the men inside of their sleeping quarters and burning them to death.\n\n\nAfter his victory and the capture of his brother \n, Atahualpa was fasting in the \n outside \n. Pizarro and his men reached the city on 15 November 1532.\n\nPizarro sent \n to the Atahualpa's camp. Soto rode to meet Atahualpa on his horse, an animal that Atahualpa had never seen before. With one of his young interpreters, Soto read a prepared speech to Atahualpa telling him that they had come as servants of God to teach them the truth about God's word.\n He said he was speaking to them so that they might: \n\n\"lay the foundation of concord, brotherhood, and perpetual peace that should exist between us, so that you may receive us under your protection and hear the divine law from us and all your people may learn and receive it, for it will be the greatest honor, advantage, and salvation to them all.\"\n Additionally, they invited the Inca leader to visit Pizarro at his quarters along the Cajamarca plaza. When De Soto noticed Atahualpa's interest in his horse, he put on a display of \"excellent horsemanship\" in close proximity. Atahualpa displayed hospitality by serving refreshments.\n\n\nAtahualpa responded only after Francisco Pizarro's brother, \n, arrived. He replied with what he had heard from his scouts, that that the Spanish had been killing and enslaving countless numbers of people and civilians on the coast. Pizarro denied the report and Atahualpa, with limited information, reluctantly let the matter go. At the end of their meeting, the men agreed to meet the next day at Cajamarca.\n\n\nThe next morning, on 16 November 1532, Pizarro had arranged an ambuscade around the Cajamarca plaza, where they were to meet. At this point, Pizarro had in total 168 men under his command: 106 on foot and 62 on horseback. When Atahualpa arrived with about 6,000 unarmed followers, Friar \n and the interpreter \n met them and proceeded to \"expound the doctrines of the true faith\" \n and seek his tribute as a vassal of King Charles. The unskilled translator likely contributed to problems in communication. The friar offered Atahualpa the \n as the authority of what he had just stated. Atahualpa stated, \"I will be no man's tributary.\"\n\n\nPizarro urged attack, starting the \n. The battle began with a shot from a cannon and the battle cry \n The Spaniards unleashed volleys of gunfire at the vulnerable mass of Incas and surged forward in a concerted action. Pizarro also used devastating cavalry charges against the Inca forces, which stunned them in combination with the supporting gunfire.\n However, many of the guns used by the Spaniards were hard to use in close-quarters combat. The effect was devastating, and the shocked Incas offered such feeble resistance that the battle has often been labeled a \n, with the 2,000 Incas slain and the Spanish with only one soldier wounded.\n\nThough the historical accounts relating to the circumstances vary, the true Spanish motives for the attack seemed to be a desire for loot and flat-out impatience. The Inca likely did not adequately understand the \n' demands.\n  Pizarro knew that his forces were badly outnumbered but that capturing the Emperor and holding him hostage would give him a key edge.\n\nThe majority of Atahualpa's troops were in the Cuzco region along with Quisquis and Challcuchima, the two generals he trusted the most. This was a major disadvantage for the Inca. Their undoing also resulted from a lack of self-confidence, and a desire to make public demonstration of fearlessness and godlike command of situation.\n The main view is that the Inca were eventually defeated due to inferior weapons, 'open battle' \n, disease, internal unrest, the bold tactics of the Spanish, and the capture of the Inca's Emperor.  Spanish armor was very effective against most of the \n weapons, though it was not entirely impenetrable to maces, clubs, or \n.\n  Later, most natives adapted in 'guerrilla fashion' by only shooting at the legs of the conquistadors if they happened to be unarmored.\n However, ensuing hostilities such as the \n, \n, and \n would require that the conquistadors ally with friendly tribes in these later expeditions.\n\nBy February 1533, Almagro had joined Pizarro in Cajamarca with an additional 150 men with 50 horses.\n\n\nAfter the Spanish captured Atahualpa at the massacre at Cajamarca, they allowed his wives to join him, and the Spanish soldiers taught him the game of \n.\n During Atahualpa's captivity, the Spanish, although greatly outnumbered, forced him to order his generals to back down by threatening to kill him if he did not. According to the Spanish envoy's demands, Atahualpa offered to fill a large \n and promised twice that amount in silver. While Pizarro ostensibly accepted this offer and allowed the gold to pile up, he had no intention of releasing the Inca. He needed Atahualpa's influence over his generals and the people in order to maintain the peace. The treasure began to be delivered from Cuzco on 20 December 1532 and flowed steadily from then on. By 3 May 1533 Pizarro received all the treasure he had requested; it was melted, refined, and made into bars.\n Hernando Pizarro went to gather gold and silver from the temples in \n in January 1533, and on his return in March,\n captured Chalcuchimac in the \n Valley.  Francisco Pizzaro sent a similar expedition to Cuzco, bringing back many gold plates from the Temple of the Sun.\n\nThe question eventually came up of what to do with Atahualpa; both Pizarro and Soto reportedly spoke against killing him, but the other Spaniards were loud in their demands for death. False interpretations from the interpreter Felipillo made the Spaniards paranoid. They were told that Atahualpa had ordered secret attacks and his warriors were hidden in the surrounding area. Soto went with a small force to scout for the hidden army, and the show trial of Atahualpa was held in his absence. Among the charges were polygamy, incestuous marriage, and idolatry, all frowned upon in Catholicism but common in Inca culture and religion.\n\nThe men who were against Atahualpa's conviction and murder argued that he should be judged by King Charles since he was the sovereign prince. Atahualpa was forced to submit to baptism to avoid being burned at the stake and in the hopes of one day rejoining his army and killing the Spanish; they referred to him as Francisco for the purposes of the ritual. On 29 August 1533 the Spanish captors murdered Atahualpa by \n. He was buried with Christian rites in the church of San Francisco at Cajamarca, but was soon disinterred. His body was recovered, probably at his prior request, and borne to its final resting place in Quito. Upon de Soto's return, he was furious; he had found no evidence of any secret gathering of Atahualpa's warriors.\n\n\nPizarro advanced with his army of 500 Spaniards toward \n, accompanied by Chalcuchimac. The latter was burned alive in the Jauja Valley, accused of secret communication with Quizquiz, and organizing resistance. \n joined Pizarro after the death of \n.  Pizarro's force entered the heart of the \n on 15 November 1533.\n\n\nBenalcázar, Pizarro's lieutenant and fellow Extremaduran, had already departed from San Miguel with 140 foot soldiers and a few horses on his conquering mission to Ecuador. At the foot of Mount \n, near the modern city of Riobamba (Ecuador) he met and defeated the forces of the great Inca warrior \n with the aid of Cañari tribesmen who served as guides and allies to the conquering Spaniards. Rumiñahui fell back to Quito, and, while in pursuit of the Inca army, Benalcázar was joined by five hundred men led by Guatemalan Governor \n. Greedy for gold, Alvarado had set sail for the south without the crown's authorization, landed on the Ecuadorian coast, and marched inland to the Sierra. Finding Quito empty of its people's treasure, Alvarado soon joined the combined Spanish force.  Alvarado agreed to sell his fleet of twelve ships, his forces, plus arms and ammunition, and returned to Guatemala.\n\n\nAfter Atahualpa's murder, Pizarro installed Atahualpa's brother, \n, as a puppet Inca ruler, but he soon died unexpectedly, leaving \n in power. He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's murder meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumiñahui, Zope-Zupahua and \n, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire.\n\n\nManco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby \n valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco.\n\n\nManco Inca hoped to use the disagreement between Almagro and Pizarro to his advantage and attempted the recapture of Cuzco starting in April 1536. The \n was waged until the following spring, and during that time Manco's armies managed to wipe out four relief columns sent from Lima, but was ultimately unsuccessful in its goal of routing the Spaniards from the city. The Inca leadership did not have the full support of all its subject peoples and furthermore, the degrading state of Inca morale coupled with the superior Spanish siege weapons soon made Manco Inca realize his hope of recapturing Cuzco was failing. Manco Inca eventually withdrew to Tambo.\n\n\nArchaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists, showing that the Spanish conquistadors were aided by native Indian allies. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that European weapons killed the natives, probably during the uprising in 1536,\n but that the vast majority had been killed by local, indigenous weapons.\n\n\nAfter the Spanish re-occupied Cuzco, Manco Inca and his armies retreated to the fortress at \n where he, for a time, successfully launched attacks against Pizarro based at Cuzco and even managed to defeat the Spanish occupiers in an open battle.\n\n\nWhen it became clear that defeat was imminent, Manco Inca retreated further to the mountainous region\n of \n and established the small \n, where Manco Inca and his successors continued to hold some power for several more decades. His son, \n, was the last Inca, being killed by the Spanish in 1572.\n\nIn total, the conquest took about forty years to complete. Many Inca attempts to regain their empire had occurred, but none had been successful. Thus the Spanish conquest was achieved, aided by factors like smallpox and a great communication and cultural divide. The Spaniards destroyed much of the Inca culture and imposed Spanish culture onto the native population.\n\nA struggle for power resulted in a long civil war between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro in which Almagro was killed. Almagro's loyal followers and his descendants later avenged his death by killing Pizarro in 1541.  This was done inside the palace of Francisco Pizarro in a fight to the death by these assassins, most of which were former soldiers of Diego de Almagro who were stripped of title and belongings after his death.\n\n\nDespite the war, the Spaniards did not neglect the colonizing process. Spanish royal authority on these territories was consolidated by the creation of an \n, a type of \n. In January 1535, \n was founded,\n from which the political and administrative institutions were to be organized. In 1542, the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castile, that shortly after would be called \n. Nevertheless, the Viceroyalty of Peru was not organized until the arrival of a later Viceroy, \n, in 1569. \n ended the indigenous \n in Vilcabamba, executing the Inca \n. He resettled the indigenous people in Spanish-style settlements in a process called \n, promoted economic development using commercial monopoly and increased the production of the silver mines of \n, using an Inca institution of forced labor for mandatory public service called \n.\n\nThe integration of Spanish culture into Peru was carried out not only by Pizarro and his other captains, but also by the many Spanish who also came to Peru to exploit its riches and inhabit its land.  These included many different kinds of immigrants such as Spanish merchants, peasants, artisans, and Spanish women. Another element that the Spanish brought with them were African \n to work alongside captive Incas for use in labor with things such as agriculture and mining for silver.\n These people all brought with them their own pieces of Spanish culture to integrate into Peruvian society.\n\nThe long-term effects of the arrival of the Spanish on the population of South America were catastrophic. While this was the case for every group of Native-Americans invaded by Europeans during this time period, the Inca population suffered an exceptionally dramatic and rapid decline following contact. The population decline for the Inca Empire from 1520 to 1571 is roughly estimated at from 10 to 12 million in 1520 to less than 3 million in 1570 with the population still declining after 1570.\n\n\nThe single greatest cause of the decimation of native populations was Old World infectious diseases, carried by colonists and conquistadors. As these were new to the natives, they had no acquired immunity and suffered very high rates of death. More died of disease than any army or armed conflict.\n As the Inca did not have as strong a writing tradition as the Aztec or Maya, it is difficult for historians to estimate population decline or any events after conquest. But, it is sometimes argued, and equally disputed among scholars that the Inca began to contract these diseases several years before the Spanish appeared in the region, as it was possibly carried to their empire by traders and travelers. The outbreak, argued to be hemorrhagic \n, reached the Andes in 1524. While numbers are unavailable, Spanish records indicate that the population was so devastated by disease that they could hardly resist the foreign forces.\n\nHistorians differ as to whether the illness of the 1520s was smallpox; a minority of scholars claim that the epidemic was due to an indigenous illness called Carrion's disease. In any case, a 1981 study by N. D. Cook the shows that the Andes suffered from three separate population declines during colonization. The first was of 30–50 percent during the first outbreak of \n. When a \n outbreak occurred, there was another decline of 25–30 percent. Finally, when smallpox and measles epidemics occurred together, which occurred from 1585 to 1591, a decline of 30–60 percent occurred. Collectively these declines amounted to a decline of 93 percent from the pre-contact population in the Andes region.\n Mortality was particularly high among children, ensuring that the impact of the epidemics would extend to the next generation.\n\n\nBeyond the devastation of the local populations by disease, they suffered considerable enslavement, pillaging and destruction from warfare. The Spanish took thousands of women from the local natives to use as servants and concubines. As Pizarro and his men took over portions of South America, they plundered and enslaved countless people. Some local populations entered into vassalage willingly, to defeat the Inca. Native groups such as the \n, \n, \n, and \n fought alongside the Spanish as they opposed Inca rule. The basic policy of the Spanish towards local populations was that voluntary vassalage would yield safety and coexistence, while continued resistance would result in more deaths and destruction.\n\n\nAnother significant effect on the people in South America was the spread of Christianity. As Pizarro and the Spanish subdued the continent and brought it under their control, they forcefully converted many to Christianity, claiming to have educated them in the ways of the \"one true religion.\"\n With the depopulation of the local populations along with the capitulation of the Inca Empire, the Spanish missionary work after colonization began was able to continue unimpeded. It took just a generation for the entire continent to be under Christian influence.\n\n\nThe arrival of the Spanish also had an unexpected impact on the land itself. Recent research points out that the Spanish conquest altered Peru's shoreline.\n Before the Spaniards arrived, inhabitants of the arid northern Peruvian coast clad massive sandy ridges with an accidental form of \"armor\", millions of discarded mollusk shells, which protected the ridges from erosion for nearly 4700 years prior to the Spanish arrival, and produced a vast corrugated landscape that is visible from space. This incidental landscape protection came to a swift end, however, after diseases brought by Spanish colonists decimated the local population and after colonial officials resettled the survivors inland, without humans to create the protective covering, newly formed beach ridges simply eroded and vanished.\n According to archaeologist Torben Rick, parts of the northern coast of Peru may look completely natural and pristine, \"but if you rewind the clock a couple of millennia, you see that people were actively shaping this land by creating beach ridge systems\".\n\n\n's novel \n (1777), inspired by \n's \n, tells a fictitious version of the conquest of Peru to portray the author's views on the religious fanaticism of the \n and their cruelty to the natives.\n\nAn opera of Verdi, \n (1845), is set during the Conquest. In the play, an Inca called Zamoro wants to find the princess Alzira, who has been engaged to the Conquistador Gusmano.\n\nThe second act of Rameau's \n (1735) is called \n and tells the love story of a Spanish Conquistador and an Inca princess.\n\nThe Spanish Comedy \n, written by \n, dramatizes the Conquest under a religious perspective, adding allegorical characters that represents the Idolatry and the Christian conversion of the Native Peruvians.\n\nThe first part of \n's \n \n narrates the abduction of Zilia, an Inca princess, by the Spaniards during the Conquest.\n\n's play \n (1964) dramatizes the conquest of the Incas. In the play, Pizarro, Atahualpa, Valverde and other historical figures appear as characters.\n\nThis event is also narrated as a Science Fiction novelette in \n's \n (1959).\n\n\nThe \n it's the setting of the romance \n (1928) by the German novelist \n.\n\nThe conquest is also used as a starting point for the \n novel \n, where the siege of \n is used. Many historical figures are mentioned, especially Pizarro who is mentioned as the pursuer of the protagonist.\n\nThe Inca are featured in the third Campaign in \n, having a Lost City hidden in the Andes. They are also in the Multiplayer, found primarily in the areas making up \n and Argentina. In the Definitive Edition of the game they are a playable faction.\n\nThe conquest is parodied in \n TV series, in the episode \"\n\", written by John Frink.\n\n\nPizarro and his fellow conquistadors feature as antagonists in the 1982 animated serial \n.\n\nI wish Your Majesty to understand the motive that moves me to make this statement is the peace of my conscience and because of the guilt I share. For we have destroyed by our evil behaviour such a government as was enjoyed by these natives. They were so free of crime and greed, both men and women, that they could leave gold or silver worth a hundred thousand pesos in their open house. So that when they discovered that we were thieves and men who sought to force their wives and daughters to commit sin with them, they despised us. But now things have come to such a pass in offence of God, owing to the bad example we have set them in all things, that these natives from doing no evil have turned into people who can do no good.. I beg God to pardon me, for I am moved to say this, seeing that I am the last to die of the Conquistadors.\"\n\nWhen has it ever happened, either in ancient or modern times, that such amazing exploits have been achieved? Over so many climes, across so many seas, over such distances by land, to subdue the unseen and unknown? Whose deeds can be compared with those of Spain? Not even the ancient Greeks and Romans.\nWhen I set out to write for the people of today and of the future, about the conquest and discovery that our Spaniards made here in Peru, I could not but reflect that I was dealing with the greatest matters one could possibly write about in all of creation as far as secular history goes. Where have men ever seen the things they have seen here? And to think that God should have permitted something so great to remain hidden from the world for so long in history, unknown to men, and then let it be found, discovered and won all in our own time!\nThe houses are more than two hundred paces in length, and very well built, being surrounded by strong walls, three times the height of a man. The roofs are covered with straw and wood, resting on the walls. The interiors are divided into eight rooms, much better built than any we had seen before. Their walls are of very well cut stones and each lodging is surrounded by its masonry wall with doorways, and has its fountain of water in an open court, conveyed from a distance by pipes, for the supply of the house. In front of the \n, towards the open country, a stone fortress is connected with it by a staircase leading from the square to the fort. Towards the open country there is another small door, with a narrow staircase, all within the outer wall of the \n. Above the town, on the mountain side, where the houses commence, there is another fort on a hill, the greater part of which is hewn out of the rock. This is larger than the other, and surrounded by three walls, rising spirally."},

While the origins of the position are mythical and originate from the legendary foundation of the city of \n, it seems to have come into being historically around 1100 AD. Although the Inca believed the Sapa to be the son of Inti (the Inca Sun god) and often referred to him as \n or 'Son of the Sun,' the position eventually became \n, with \n.\n The principal wife of the Inca was known as the \n or Qoya.\n The Sapa Inca was at the top of the social hierarchy, and played a dominant role in the political and spiritual realm.\n\n\n, the first Inca monarch, adopted the title \n (roughly translated as \n).\n \n, the sixth Inca monarch, was evidently the first to bear the title \n (\"emperor\") officially.\n\n\nThere were two known \n, led by the Hurin and Hannan \n respectively.\n The latter was in power at the time of \n. The last effective Sapa Inca of Inca Empire was \n, who was executed by \n and his \n in 1533, but several successors later claimed the title.\n\n\nOther terms for Sapa Inca include \n (\"divinity\"), \n \n (\"mighty Inca\"), or simply \n (\"the only one\").\n\nChronicles identify the Inca as the highest ruler equivalent to European kings of the Middle Ages. However, the original access to that position was not linked to the inheritance of the eldest son, as is for a monarchy, but to the perceived selection of the gods by means of rigorous challenges, to which the physical and moral aptitudes of the pretender were tested.\n These trials were accompanied by a complex spiritual ritual through which the Sun god, Inti nominated the one who should assume the Inca position.\n Eventually, with the passage of time, Incas named their favorite son as co-governor with the intention of securing his succession,\n for example, Huiracocha Inca associated Inca Urco to the throne.\n The Coya, or Sapa Inca's primary wife, had significant influence upon making this decision of which son is apt to succeed his father.\n\n\nThe Sapa Inca was the absolute ruler of the empire and accumulated in his power the political, social, military, and economic direction of the State.\n He ordered and directed the construction of great engineering works, such as \n, a fortress that took 50 years to complete;\n or the urban plan of the cities.\n However, among their most notable works, was the network of roads that crossed the entire empire and allowed a rapid journey for the administrators, messengers, and armies\n provided with hanging bridges and \n.\n They made sure to always be supplied and well cared for,\n as is reflected in the construction of storehouses scattered throughout the empire and vast food and resource redistribution systems.\n The commander and chief of the standing army founded military colonies to expand the culture and control, while simultaneously ensuring the preservation of that network.\n\n\nAt the religious level, they were symbolic of the sun and promoted the worship of Inti, who was regarded as their ancestral father,\n and organized the calendar.\n At the political level, they sent inspectors to oversee the loyalty and efficiency of civil servants and collect tribute from the subjugated peoples.\n The emperors promoted a unified and decentralized government in which Cuzco acted as the articulating axis of the different regions or Suyu.\n They appointed highly trusted governors.\n At the economic level, they decided how much each province should pay according to its resources.\n They knew how to win over the curacas to ensure control of the communities. These were the intermediaries through whom they collected taxes.\n\n\nTraditionally, every time an emperor died or resigned, his successor was disinherited from his father's inheritance and formed his own lineage royal clan or \n, his father's lands, houses and servants were passed to his other children remaining on the previous Panaka. The new Sapa Inca had to obtain land and spoils to bequeath to his own descendants.\n Each time they subdued a people, they demanded that the defeated leader surrender part of their land to continue in command, and whose people pay tribute in the form of labor (mita) and taxes.\n\n\nThe Sapa Inca also played a major role in caring for the poor and hungry, hence his other title \n or 'Lover and Benefactor of the Poor'.\n The Sapa was responsible for organizing food redistribution in times of environmental disaster, allocated work via state-sponsored projects, and most notably promoted major state-sponsored religious feasts\n that followed each successful harvest season.\n\n\nThe Inca was divinized, both in their actions and their emblems. In public he carried the topayauri (scepter), ushno (golden throne), suntur páucar (feathered pike), and the mascaipacha (royal insignia) commonly carried in a llauto (headband), otherwise, the mascapaicha could also be carried on an amachana chuku (military helmet).\n In religious ceremonies he was accompanied by the sacred white flame, the napa, covered with a red blanket and adorned with gold earrings.\n With textiles representing a form of status and wealth, it has been speculated that the Sapa Inca never wore the same clothes twice.\n The community even revered the Sapa after his death, mummifying him and frequently visiting his tomb to \"consult\" him on pressing affairs.\n\n\nLittle is known of the rulers of the first dynasty of Sapa Incas. Evidently, they were affiliated with the Hurin moiety and their rule did not extend beyond the \n. Their origins are tied to the mythical establishment of \n and are shrouded in the later \n. The dynasty was supposedly founded by \n, who is considered the son of the \n \n in \n.\n\n\nAs a rough guide to the later reputation of the early Sapa Incas, in later years \n meant warlord and \n meant leader.\n\nThe second dynasty was affiliated with the Hanan moiety and was founded under \n, the son of the last Hurin Sapa Inca, \n. After Cápac Yupanqui's death, another of his sons, Inca Roca's half-brother \n, was intended to succeed him. However, the Hanan revolted and installed Inca Roca instead.\n\n\n, who was Inca for only a few days in 1527, is sometimes left off the list of Sapa Incas because news of his death from \n arrived in Cusco very shortly after he was declared Sapa Inca. He had witnessed the death of his father Huayna Cápac. The death of Ninan, the presumed heir, led to the \n between Huáscar and Atahualpa, a weakness that the conquistadors exploited when they \n.\n\n\nThis last Sapa Inca must not be confused with \n, who was leader of an \n.\n\n\n"},

Because of this, Manco Inca was forced to flee, avoiding any contact with the atahualpists.\n\n\nOn 14 November 1533, he met the \n \n and his contingent, both Inca and Spanish.

He failed, was captured and imprisoned. Hernando Pizarro released him to recover a golden statue of his father Huayna Capac. Only accompanied by two Spaniards, he easily escaped a second time. Manco then gathered an army of 200,000 \n warriors and laid siege to Cusco in early 1536, taking advantage of Diego de Almagro's absence.\n\n\nAfter ten months (see the \n), Manco retreated to the nearby fortress of \n in 1537.

From there, he continued his attacks against the \n (one of the most important allies of the Spaniards), having some success after fierce battles, and to the highlands of present-day Bolivia, where after many battles his army was defeated.\n\nThe Spaniards crowned his younger half brother \n as puppet \n after his retreat for his valuable help in that last campaign.\n The Spanish succeeded in capturing Manco's sister-wife, \n, and had her brutally murdered in 1539.\n\nAfter many guerrilla battles in the mountainous regions of Vilcabamba, Manco was murdered in 1544 in the Inca center of \n by supporters of Diego de Almagro who had previously assassinated Francisco Pizarro and who were in hiding under Manco's protection.

The Incas hoped to restore their \n (1438–1533) with this action, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\n, Hernando's older brother, received chief rights of discovery and conquest in Peru, or \n, and the Governorship of the territory from \n of \n in the \n of July 1529.\n Pizarro and his Spanish conquistadors invaded Peru and captured \n, the Sapa Inca, on November 16, 1532, at \n.\n The events at Cajamarca initiated the Spanish \n of the Incas. The Spaniards later killed Atahualpa in July 1533, after deceptively acquiring a ransom of over 18 t (39,000 lb) of gold and silver for his release.\n Atahualpa's death exacerbated pre-existing dynastic rivalries for the Inca throne and plunged the Incas into a stage of disorder and disunity.\n Francisco Pizarro installed \n, one of Atahualpa's brothers and rivals, in September 1533, as the leading Inca in an attempt to legalistically recognize indigenous lineage and subordinate the Incas under Spanish authority.\n \n, a leader of Atahualpa's remnant loyalist troops killed Tupac Hualpa at \n.\n Francisco Pizarro replaced Tupac Hualpa with Manco Inca, another one of Atahualpa's brothers, and son of the last truly unified Inca King, \n.\n Pizarro first met Manco Inca on the initial Spanish march to secure Cusco, and Pizarro's decision to emplace Manco Inca as king stemmed from the Spaniard's desire to continue and perpetuate Inca internal discord.\n \n\nManco decided to join the Spanish side in hopes of strengthening his position in the dynastic struggle against survivors of the Atahualpa loyalist faction.\n A Spanish expedition led by Francisco Pizarro had captured the Inca capital of Cusco on November 15, 1533 after defeating an Inca army headed by general \n.\n The following month, the conquistadors supported the official coronation of Manco Inca as Inca emperor to facilitate Spanish control over the Inca empire.\n Real power rested with the Spaniards and they frequently humiliated Manco when \n and \n, two of Francisco's younger brothers, controlled the city.\n Juan Pizarro imprisoned Manco after he attempted an escape in November 1535.\n Hernando Pizarro assumed control of Cusco after returning from Spain and hoping to improve relations with Manco, for both personal and Spanish interests, released the Inca leader from confinement in January 1536.\n Manco remained under Spanish supervision but achieved greater freedom of movement.\n Manco Inca left Cusco on April 18, 1536 after securing Hernando Pizarro's approval to conduct religious ceremonial activities in the \n and return with gold.\n Instead, Manco went to Lares and conducted a meeting with Inca military chiefs and warriors, over ceremonial \n, to discuss and finalize siege and rebellion plans.\n\n\nHernando, realizing the grave mistake, sent his brother Juan Pizarro and seventy \n from Cusco on a mission to disperse the Incas gathered in the nearby Yucay Valley.\n Juan Pizarro's expedition located a mass of Inca troops in the valley and cleared them out after a brief skirmish.\n The Spaniards secured the valley and remained in position for three or four days without facing any significant battles or coordinated Inca attacks.\n Juan quickly understood why he faced limited Inca resistance in the valley when a horseman dispatched by Hernando Pizarro informed Juan that Inca warriors had amassed on the hills surrounding Cusco.\n The Inca emperor did not attack Cusco at once; instead, he waited to assemble his full army estimated at between 100,000 and 200,000 men strong around the city (some sources suggest numbers as low as 40,000). Against them there were 190 Spaniards, 80 of them horsemen, and several thousand Indian auxiliaries.\n The Incas made their first move on May 5, 1536, by seizing the unoccupied \n fortress above Cusco, which the Spaniards had vacated to fortify themselves in the city.\n Sacsayhuamán provided the Incas with high-ground above the city and a favorable fortified position from which to launch offensive attacks. Additionally, the steep elevation encountered while approaching the fortress inhibited the use of cavalry, effectively neutralizing one of the Spaniards' primary tactical advantages and potential options for counter-assault.\n The siege started on May 6, 1536, with a full-scale attack towards the main square of the city; Inca warriors descended from Sacsyhuamán into the city and immediately secured the areas around \n and Cora Cora and eventually succeeded in capturing most of the city.\n The Inca warriors barraged the city with slings projecting hot stones wrapped in cotton and incendiary arrows that ignited thatched roofs and quickly spread fire throughout Cusco.\n Meanwhile, the Spaniards took refuge in two large buildings near the main plaza, barricading themselves inside the hall of Suntur Huasi and Hatun Cancha, two buildings facing each other on the eastern side of the square.\n The conquistadors fended off Inca attacks from these constructions and mounted frequent raids against their besiegers.\n The raids, with moderate but short-term success, included small waves of cavalry and foot-soldier elements sent out to break the Inca ranks.  The Incas recognized the significant battlefield effectives of horses, so the native warriors planted elevated peltasts, around the city, that launched \n to entangle and disable the cavalrymen.\n\n\nRealizing the direness of the situation, after about a week of being pinned down, the Spanish decided their survival depended on recapturing Sacsayhuamán. Pasac, a rival and relative of Manco who sided with the Spanish, devised a successful plan to assault the fortress.\n To relieve their position, the Spaniards decided to assault the walled complex of Sacsayhuamán which served as the main base of operations for the Inca army. Fifty horsemen, led by Juan Pizarro, and accompanied by Indian auxiliaries, broke through the Inca army files and burst off at a gallop toward Chinchaysuyo. The Spaniards continued northwest, feigning retreat toward Lima, which drew Inca warriors out from the fortress.\n Then Pizarro and his men turned around and attacked Sacsayhuamán from outside the city. During the frontal assault against the building's large walls, a stone struck Juan Pizarro in the head; he died days later from the injury. The following day, the Spaniards resisted several Inca counterattacks and mounted a renewed assault at night using scaling ladders. In this way, they captured the terrace walls of Sacsayhuamán while the Inca army held on to the two tall towers of the complex. The Inca commanders, Paucar Huaman and the high priest or \n, decided to leave the confinement of the towers and fight their way towards Calca, the site of Manco Inca's headquarters, to bring back reinforcements. The attempt was successful and the towers were left under the command of Titu Cusi Gualpa, an Inca nobleman. Despite Titu's fierce resistance, the Spaniards and their auxiliaries stormed the towers so that when the Inca commanders returned, Sacsayhuamán was firmly under their control.\n\n\nThe capture of Sacsayhuamán eased the pressure on the Spanish garrison at Cusco; the fighting now turned into a series of daily skirmishes interrupted only by the Inca religious tradition of halting attacks during the \n.\n During this period, the Spaniards successfully implemented terror tactics to demoralize the Inca army, which included an order to kill any woman caught and cutting off the hands of captured men.\n Encouraged by their successes, Hernando Pizarro led an attack against Manco Inca's headquarters which were now at \n, further away from Cusco.  Manco Inca defeated the Spanish expedition at the \n by taking advantage of the fortifications and the difficult terrain around the site.\n The Spanish garrison had more success with several raids to gather food from regions near Cusco; these incursions allowed them to replenish their almost exhausted provisions.\n Meanwhile, Manco Inca tried to capitalize on his success at Ollantaytambo with a renewed assault on Cusco, but a Spanish cavalry party had a chance encounter with the Inca army thus ruining any hope of surprise. That same night the Spaniards mounted a full-scale attack which achieved complete surprise and inflicted severe casualties on Manco Inca's troops.\n\n\nAfter 10 months of vicious fighting in Cusco, with low morale playing a factor, Manco Inca decided to raise the siege at Cusco and withdraw to \n and then \n, where he established the small \n. It is suggested by some that by this action he threw away his only real chance to expel the Spaniards from the lands of the \n, but it was probably the only realistic choice he had considering the arrival of Spanish reinforcements from Chile led by \n. Recognizing the opportunity of expanding his own reign into Peru, Almagro seized the city once having achieved victory for Spain and had Hernando and Gonzalo Pizarro imprisoned. Gonzalo then escaped, to later defeat Almagro at the \n.\n\n\n\n"},

These auxiliaries acted as guides, translators and porters, and in these roles were also referred to as \n, particularly during the \n. The term was also used for formations composed of indigenous warriors which were used by the Spanish for reconnaissance and combat duties. Indian auxiliaries continued to be used by the Spanish to maintain control over their colonies in the Americas; frequently stationed on the \n, they were often used to suppress anti-colonial revolts such as \n.\n\nThe formations of auxiliary Indians arose commonly from alliances established by the \n, exploiting ethnic and tribal antagonisms that they found during their occupation of the territory they were attempting to conquer.  \n was one of the first captains who was known to strengthen his columns with these natives. Commonly after the conquest these auxiliary Indians were divided among the \n of the territories already conquered. They often constituted the most numerous group of the conquerors' followers:\n\nDuring \n' campaign against the Aztecs from 1519 to 1521, he supplemented his meagre force of Spanish soldiers (numbering some 1,300) with hundreds of thousands of native auxiliaries, from various states such as \n. During the final siege of the Aztec capital city of \n, Cortés, according to the account of one of his soldiers, \n, had some 200,000 Tlaxcallan and other native auxiliaries, while the Aztec warriors drawn from the numerous cities surrounding \n in the \n numbered more than 300,000.\n\nThe expedition of \n to \n was composed of 480 Spaniards and thousands of auxiliary Indians from \n, \n and other cities in central Mexico.\n In Guatemala the Spanish routinely fielded indigenous allies; at first these were \n brought from the recently conquered Mexico, later they also included \n. It is estimated that for every Spaniard on the field of battle, there were at least 10 native auxiliaries. Sometimes there were as many as 30 indigenous warriors for every Spaniard, and it was the participation of these Mesoamerican allies that was particularly decisive.\n Some newly conquered Maya groups remained loyal to the Spanish once they had submitted to the conquest, such as the \n and the \n of \n, and provided them with warriors to assist further conquest.\n\n\nIn 1524, fresh from his victory over the Tz'utujil, Pedro de Alvarado led his army against the non-Maya \n of the Guatemalan Pacific lowlands.\n At this point Alvarado's force consisted of 250 Spanish infantry accompanied by 6,000 indigenous allies, mostly \n and Cholutec.\n\n\nThe \n fortress of \n was attacked by \n, brother of Pedro de Alvarado,\n in 1525, with 40 Spanish cavalry and 80 Spanish infantry,\n and some 2,000 Mexican and K'iche' allies.\n When the Spanish besieged the \n city of \n in 1530, their indigenous allies managed to scale the walls, penetrate the stronghold and set it on fire. Many defending Ixil warriors withdrew to fight the fire, which allowed the Spanish to storm the entrance and break the defences.\n\n\nAfter the initial conquest, most of these allies were considered less necessary and, sometimes, a liability. At times they were needed for defense of the extended \n. They were incorporated into the military forces of the Empire, forming their own units, organised along European models under their own names, such as \n (\"Companies of Noble Indians\"). The necessity of defence came from either European threats like the Caribbean buccaneers and pirates or American threats such as the \n, \n or \n tribes or the protracted \n. These units fought in the independence wars.\n\n"},
{"title": "Cusco - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n or \n (\n; \n: \n (\n) is a city in southeastern \n near the \n of the \n mountain range and the Huatanay river. It is the capital of the \n and of the \n. The city is the \n; in 2017, it had a population of 428,450. Its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). \n\nThe city was the capital of the \n from the 13th century until the 16th-century \n. In 1983, Cusco was declared a \n by \n with the title \"City of Cuzco\". It has become a major tourist destination, hosting over 2 million visitors a year and providing passage to numerous Incan ruins, such as \n, one of the \n and others. The \n (1993) designates the city as the Historical Capital of Peru.\n The city is often dubbed the ''Rome of America''. \n\nThe indigenous name of this city is \n. Although the name was used in \n, its origin is found in the \n. The word is derived from the phrase \n ('rock of the owl'), related to the city's foundation myth of the Ayar siblings. According to this legend, Ayar Awqa (\n) acquired wings and flew to the site of the future city; there he was transformed into a rock to mark the possession of the land by his \n (\"lineage\"):\n\n\nThen Ayar Oche stood up, displayed a pair of large wings, and said he should be the one to stay at \n as an idol in order to speak with their father the Sun.  Then they went up on top of the hill.  Now at the site where he was to remain as an idol, Ayar Oche raised up in flight toward the heavens so high that they could not see him.  He returned and told Ayar Manco that from then on he was to be named \n.  Ayar Oche came from where the Sun was and the Sun had ordered that Ayar Manco take that name and go to the town that they had seen.  After this had been stated by the idol, Ayar Oche turned into a stone, just as he was, with his wings. Later Manco Capac went down with Ayar Auca to their settlement...he liked the place now occupied in this city Cuzco.  Manco Capac and his companion, with the help of the four women, made a house.  Having done this, Manco Capac and his companion, with the four women, planted some land with maize.  It is said that they took the maize from the cave, which this lord Manco Capac named \n, which means those of origin because...they came out of that cave.\nThe \n \n (Spanish soldiers) adopted the local name, \n it according to Spanish phonetics as \n or, less often, \n. \n was the standard spelling on official documents and chronicles in colonial times,\n though \n was also used. \n, pronounced as in 16th-century Spanish, seems to have been a close approximation to the Cusco Quechua pronunciation of the name at the time.\n\n\nAs both Spanish and Quechua pronunciation have evolved since then, the Spanish pronunciation of 'z' is no longer universally close to the Quechua pronunciation. In 1976, the city mayor signed an ordinance banning the traditional spelling and ordering the use of a new spelling, \n, in \n publications. Nineteen years later, on 23 June 1990, the local authorities formalized a new spelling more closely related to Quechua, \n, but later administrations have not followed suit.\n\n\nThere is no international, official spelling of the city's name. In English-language publications both \"s\"\n and \"z\"\n can be found.  The \n and \n prefer \"Cuzco\",\n and in scholarly writings \"Cuzco\" is used more often than \"Cusco\".\n The city's international airport code is \n, reflecting the earlier Spanish spelling.\n\n, 1197–1438\n\n\n \n, 1438–1532\n\n\n \n (\n and \n), 1532–1700 \n\n\n \n (\n), 1700–1808 \n\n\n \n (\n), 1808–1813 \n\n\n \n (\n), 1813–1821 \n\n\n \n, 1821–1822\n\n\n, 1822–1836\n\n\n \n (\n), 1836–1839 \n\n\n, 1839–present\n\nThe \n people occupied the region from 900 to 1200 CE, prior to the arrival of the \n in the 13th century. \n of \n, the walled complex outside Cusco, established that Killke constructed the fortress about 1100 CE. The Inca later expanded and occupied the complex in the 13th century. In March 2008, \n discovered the ruins of an ancient temple, roadway and \n system at Saksaywaman.\n The temple covers some 2,700 square feet (250 square meters) and contains 11 rooms thought to have held idols and mummies,\n establishing its religious purpose. Together with the results of excavations in 2007, when another temple was found at the edge of the fortress, this indicates a longtime religious as well as military use of the facility.\n\n\nCusco was long an important center of indigenous people. It was the capital of the \n (13th century – 1532). Many believe that the city was planned as an \n in the shape of a \n, a \n animal.\n How Cusco was specifically built, or how its large stones were quarried and transported to the site remain undetermined. Under the Inca, the city had two sectors: the \n and \n. Each was divided to encompass two of the four provinces, \n (NW), \n (NE), \n (SW) and \n (SE). A road led from each quarter to the corresponding quarter of the empire.\n\nEach local leader was required to build a house in the city and live part of the year in Cusco, restricted to the quarter that corresponded to the quarter in which he held territory. After the rule of \n, when an \n died, his title went to one son and his property was given to a corporation controlled by his other relatives (\n). Each title holder had to build a new house and add new lands to the empire in order to own land for his family to keep after his death.\n\nAccording to Inca legend, the city was rebuilt by \n \n, the man who transformed the Kingdom of Cuzco from a sleepy city-state into the vast empire of \n.\n Archeological evidence, however, points to a slower, more organic growth of the city beginning before Pachacuti. The city was constructed according to a definite plan in which two rivers were channeled around the city. Archeologists have suggested that this city plan was replicated at other sites.\n\nThe city fell to the sphere of \n during the \n after the death of \n in 1528. It was captured by the generals of \n in April 1532 in the \n. Nineteen months later, Spanish explorers invaded the city after kidnapping and murdering Atahualpa (see \n), and gained control.\n\nThe first three \n arrived in the city in May 1533, after the \n, collecting for \n's \n. On 15 November 1533 \n officially arrived in Cusco. \"The capital of the Incas ... astonished the Spaniards by the beauty of its edifices, the length and regularity of its streets.\" The great square was surrounded by several palaces, since \"each sovereign built a new palace for himself.\" \"The delicacy of the stone work excelled\" that of the Spaniards'. The fortress had three \n and was composed of \"heavy masses of rock\". \"Through the heart of the capital ran a river ... faced with stone. ... The most sumptuous edifice in Cuzco ... was undoubtedly the great temple dedicated to the Sun ... studded with gold plates ... surrounded by convents and dormitories for the priests. ... The palaces were numerous and the troops lost no time in plundering them of their contents, as well as despoiling the religious edifices,\" including the royal mummies in the \n.\n\n\nPizarro ceremoniously gave \n the Incan fringe as the new Peruvian leader.\n Pizarro encouraged some of his men to stay and settle in the city, giving out \n, or land grants to do so.\n \n were established and \n on 24 March 1534, which included the brothers \n and \n. Pizarro left a garrison of 90 men and departed for \n with Manco Inca.\n\n\nPizarro renamed it as the \"very noble and great city of Cuzco\". Buildings often constructed after the Spanish invasion have a mixture of Spanish influence and Inca \n, including the Santa Clara and San Blas neighborhoods. The Spanish destroyed many Inca buildings, temples and palaces. They used the remaining walls as bases for the construction of a new city, and this stone masonry is still visible.\n\nFather \n became the Bishop of Cusco and built his cathedral facing the \n. He supported construction of the \n monastery (\n) on the ruins of the Corichanca, House of the Sun, and a convent at the former site of the House of the Virgins of the Sun.\n\n\nDuring the \n of 1536 by \n, a leader of the \n, he took control of the city from the Spanish. Although the siege lasted 10 months, it was ultimately unsuccessful. Manco's forces were able to reclaim the city for only a few days. He eventually retreated to \n, the capital of the newly established small \n. There his state survived another 36 years but he was never able to return to Cuzco. Throughout the conflict and years of the \n, many Incas died of \n epidemics, as they had no acquired immunity to a disease by then endemic among Europeans.\n\nCusco was built on layers of cultures. The Tawantinsuyu (former \n) was built on \n structures. The Spanish replaced \n temples with Catholic churches, and Inca palaces with mansions for the invaders.\n\nCusco was the center for the Spanish colonization and spread of Christianity in the \n world. It became very prosperous thanks to agriculture, cattle raising and mining, as well as its trade with \n. The Spanish colonists constructed many churches and \n, as well as a \n, \n and \n.\n\nA major earthquake on 21 May hit in 1950, and caused damage in more than one third of the city's structures. The Dominican Priory and Church of Santo Domingo, which were built on top of the impressive \n (Temple of the Sun), were among the affected colonial era buildings. Inca architecture withstood the earthquake. Many of the old Inca walls were at first thought to have been lost after the earthquake, but the \n retaining walls of the \n were exposed, as well as those of other ancient structures throughout the city. Restoration work at the Santo Domingo complex exposed the Inca masonry formerly obscured by the superstructure without compromising the integrity of the colonial heritage.\n Many of the buildings damaged in 1950 had been impacted by an earthquake only nine years previously.\n\n\nIn the 1990s, during the \n of Mayor \n, the city underwent a new process of beautification through the restoration of monuments and the construction of plazas, fountains and monuments. Likewise, thanks to the efforts of this authority, various recognitions were achieved, such as the declaration as \"Historical Capital of Peru\" contained in the text of the Political Constitution of Peru of 1993. It was also decided to change the coat of arms of Cusco, leaving aside the colonial coat of arms and adopting the \"\n\" as the new coat of arms. Additionally, the change of the official name of the city was proposed to adopt the Quechua word \n, but this change was reversed a few years later. Currently, Cusco is the most important tourist destination in Peru. Under the administration of mayor Daniel Estrada Pérez, a staunch supporter of the \n, between 1983 and 1995 the \n name \n was officially adopted for the city. Tourism in the city was drastically affected by the \n and the \n, with the latter event costing the area 10 million soles daily.\n\n\nCusco extends throughout the Huatanay (or Watanay) river valley. Located on the eastern end of the Knot of Cusco\n, its elevation is around 3,400 m (11,200 ft). To its north is the \n with 4,000–6,000-meter-high (13,000–20,000-foot) mountains. The highest peak is \n (6,271 meters or 20,574 feet) about 60 kilometers (37 miles) northwest of Cusco.\n\n\nCusco has a \n (\n \n). It is generally dry and temperate, with two defined seasons. Winter occurs from April through September, with abundant sunshine and occasional nighttime freezes; July is the coldest month with an average of 9.7 °C (49.5 °F). Summer occurs from October through March, with warm temperatures and abundant rainfall; November is the warmest month, averaging 13.3 °C (55.9 °F). Although frost and hail are common, the last reported snowfall was in June 1911. Temperatures usually range from 0.2 to 20.9 °C (32.4 to 69.6 °F), but the all-time temperature range is between −8.9 and 30 °C (16.0 and 86.0 °F). Sunshine hours peak in July, the equivalent of January in the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, February, the equivalent of August in the Northern Hemisphere, has the least sunshine.\n\nIn 2006, Cusco was found to be the spot on Earth with the highest average \n light level.\n\n\nThroughout its history, Cusco has had a marked political importance. During the Inca period, it was the main political center of the region from which the \n was ruled and where the political and religious elite lived. After its Spanish foundation, it lost prominence due to \n's decision to establish the capital of the new territories in the city of \n because it had close access to the sea and communication with the metropolis. However, Cusco continued to be an important city within the viceregal political scheme to the point of being the first city in the entire Viceroyalty to have a bishop.Its participation in the trade routes during the viceroyalty guaranteed its political importanceIt remained the capital of the corregimiento established in these territories and, later, of the Intendancy of Cusco and, towards the end of the viceroyalty, of the Royal Audience of Cusco.\n\nDuring the republic, Cusco's political role languished due to its isolation from the capital, coastline, and trade routes of the 19th and 20th centuries. However, it maintained its status as the main city in southern Peru, although subordinated to the importance that \n was gaining, better connected with the rest of the country. Cusco has always remained the capital of the department of Cusco\n\nPolitically, according to the results of elections held in the second half of the 20th century, Cusco has been a stronghold of leftist parties in Peru. In the 1970s and 1980s, the socialist leader \n brought together this political tendency under the banner of the \n alliance. Since his death, Cusco has been a major city for parties such as the \n and the Broad Front for Justice, Life and Liberty, as well as regional movements. Traditional Peruvian parties, such as the Peruvian Aprista Party and Acción Popular, have recorded eventual electoral victories, while those that represent a right-wing political position, such as the Popular Christian Party and \n itself, have had little presence among the elected authorities.\n\nThe city had a population of about 434,114 people in 2013 and 434,654 people in 2015 according to \n.\n\nEconomic activity in Cuzco includes agriculture, especially maize and native tubers. The local industry is related to extractive activities and to food and beverage products, such as beer, carbonated waters, coffee, chocolates, among others. However, the relevant economic activity of its inhabitants is the reception of tourism, with increasingly better infrastructure and services. It is the second city in this country that has and maintains full employment.\n\nTourism has been the backbone to the Cusco economy since the early 2000s, bringing in more than 1.2 million tourists per year.\n In 2019, Cusco was the region that reached the highest number of tourists in Peru with more than 2.7 million tourists.\n  In 2002, the income Cusco received from tourism was US$837 million. In 2009, that number increased to US$2.47 billion. \n Most tourists visiting the city are there to tour thew city and the Incan Ruins, especially the top destination, \n, which is one of the Seven Modern Wonders of the World. \n\nIn order to keep up with tourist demand, the city is constructing a new airport in \n known as \n. It's main purpose is for tourists to bypass lay overs through Lima and connect the city to Europe and North America. It will replace the old airport, \n. \n\n\n\nDue to its antiquity and significance, the center of the city preserves many buildings, squares and streets from pre-Columbian times as well as colonial constructions. That is why the city was declared in 1972 \nCultural Heritage of the Nation\n by Supreme Resolution No. 2900-72-ED.In 1983, during the VII session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, it was decided to declare this area as a \n by establishing a central zone that constitutes the World Heritage Site proper and a buffer zone.\n\nOne of the characteristics that the Incas achieved with their urban plan in Cusco was the respect for the geographical matrix when building their fabric, since they responded with different design strategies to the rugged topography of the Andean area at 3399 meters above sea level\n\nThe native language is \n, although the city's inhabitants mostly speak Spanish. The \n are the last living descendants of the \n. \n\nCusco has the following important museums:\n\n\n\nThere are also some museums located at churches.\nThe most common religion in Cusco is \n. \n\n\nAs capital to the Inca Empire, Cusco was an important agricultural region. It was a natural reserve for thousands of native Peruvian species, including around 3,000 varieties of potato cultivated by the people.\n Fusion and neo-Andean restaurants developed in Cusco, in which the cuisine is prepared with modern techniques and incorporates a blend of traditional Andean and international ingredients.\n Cuy, guinea pig, a native animal in Cusco, is a popular dish in the city. \n\n\nFolkloric institution established in 1924. It is considered to be the most important folkloric institution in the cityand was recognized by the Peruvian government as the country's first folkloric institutionand by the regional government as Living Cultural Heritage of the Cusco region.\n\n, or soccer, is the most popular sport in Cusco. The city was a venue for the \n, where its largest stadium \n hosted the third place play-off match. Cusco has three large football clubs, \n, \n and \n, all of which participate in the \n and play at Estadio Garcilaso, which has a capacity of 45,000. Cienciano is the only Peruvian club to win an international tournament, winning the \n and \n.\n\nThe \n \n built the walled complex of \n about 1100. The Killke built a major temple near Saksaywaman, as well as an \n (\n) and roadway connecting prehistoric structures. Sacsayhuamán was expanded by the \n.\n\nThe Spanish explorer \n sacked much of the Inca city in 1535. Remains of the palace of the Incas, \n (the Temple of the Sun), and the Temple of the Virgins of the Sun still stand. Inca buildings and foundations in some cases proved to be stronger during earthquakes than foundations built in present-day Peru. Among the most noteworthy Spanish colonial buildings of the city is the \n.\n\nThe major nearby Inca sites are Pachacuti's presumed winter home, \n, which can be reached on foot by the \n or by train; and the \"fortress\" at \n.\n\nLess-visited \n include: \n, the highest of all Inca sites at 3,980 m (13,060 ft);\n \n, the capital of the Inca after the Spanish capture of Cusco; the \n at \n (aka Chuqip'allta, Yuraq Rumi); \n, with working water channels in wide terraces; as well as \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and many others.\n\nThe surrounding area, located in the Watanay Valley, is strong in gold mining and agriculture, including \n, \n, \n, tea and coffee.\n\nCusco's main stadium \n was one of seven stadiums used when Peru hosted South America's continental soccer championship, the \n, in \n.

Among the main sights of the city are:\n\nThis neighborhood houses artisans, workshops and craft shops. It is one of the most picturesque sites in the city. Its streets are steep and narrow with old houses built by the Spanish over important Inca foundations. It has an attractive square and the oldest parish church in Cusco, built in 1563, which has a carved wooden pulpit considered the epitome of Colonial era woodwork in Cusco.\n\nThe Quechua name of this neighborhood is \n, which means the opening of the salt.\n\nThis street is the most visited by tourists. On the street Hatun Rumiyoq (\"the one with the big stone\") was the palace of \n, which was converted to the Archbishop's residence.\n\nAlong this street that runs from the \n to the Barrio de San Blas, one can see the \n, which is viewed as a marvel of ancient stonework and has become emblematic of the city's history.\n\nIts foundation dates from 1536. The first complex was destroyed by the earthquake of 1650. Its rebuilding was completed in 1675.\n\nIts cloisters of \n \n style, choir stalls, colonial paintings and wood carvings are highlights, now a popular museum.\n\nAlso on view is an elaborate \n made of gold and gemstones that weighs 22 kg (49 lb) and is 130 cm (51.18 in) in height.\n\nThe first cathedral built in Cusco is the \n, built in 1539 on the foundations of the Palace of \n. Today, this church is an auxiliary chapel of the cathedral.\n\nThe main basilica cathedral of the city was built between 1560 and 1664. The main material used was stone, which was extracted from nearby quarries, although some blocks of red granite were taken from the fortress of Saksaywaman.\n\nThis great cathedral presents late-Gothic, Baroque and plateresque interiors and has one of the most outstanding examples of colonial goldwork. Its carved wooden altars are also important.\n\nThe city developed a distinctive style of painting known as the \"\n\" and the cathedral houses a major collection of local artists of the time. The cathedral is known for a Cusco School painting of the \n depicting \n and the \n feasting on guinea pig, a traditional Andean delicacy.\n\nThe cathedral is the seat of the \n.\n\nKnown as the \"Square of the warrior\" in the Inca era, this plaza has been the scene of several important events, such as the proclamation by \n in the conquest of Cuzco.\nSimilarly, the \n was the scene of the death of \n, considered the indigenous leader of the resistance.\n\nThe Spanish built stone arcades around the plaza which endure to this day. The main cathedral and the Church of La Compañía both open directly onto the plaza.\n\nThe cast iron fountain in Plaza de Armas was manufactured by \n\n\nThis church (Church of the Society of Jesus), whose construction was initiated by the \n in 1576 on the foundations of the \n or the palace of the Inca ruler \n, is considered one of the best examples of colonial baroque style in the Americas.\n\n\nIts façade is carved in stone and its main altar is made of carved wood covered with gold leaf. It was built over an underground chapel and has a valuable collection of colonial paintings of the Cusco School.\nThe Qurikancha (\"golden place\") was the most important sanctuary dedicated to the Sun God (\n) at the time of the \n. According to ancient chronicles written by \n, Qurikancha was said to have featured a large solid golden disc that was studded with precious stones and represented the Inca Sun God – Inti. Spanish chroniclers describe the Sacred Garden in front of the temple as a garden of golden plants with leaves of beaten gold, stems of silver, solid gold corn-cobs and 20 life-size llamas and their herders all in solid gold.\n\n\nThe temple was destroyed by its Spanish invaders who, as they plundered, were determined to rid the city of its wealth, idolaters and shrines. Nowadays, only a curved outer wall and partial ruins of the inner temple remain at the site.\n\nWith this structure as a foundation, colonists built the \n in the Renaissance style. The building, with one baroque tower, exceeds the height of many other buildings in this city.\n\nInside is a large collection of paintings from the \n.\n\nCusco's main international airport is \n, which provides service to 5 domestic destinations and 3 international ones. It is named in honor of Peruvian pilot Alejandro Velasco Astete who was the first person to fly across the Andes in 1925 when he made the first flight from Lima to Cusco.

{"title": "Hernando Pizarro - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\n\n\n (\n \n; born between 1501 and 1508, died 1578) was a Spanish \n and one of the \n who ruled over \n.\n\nHernando was born in \n, (\n), Spain, son of Captain \n (senior) (1446–1522) – who as \n of \n served in the \n under \n, and in \n, with some distinction – and wife Isabel de Vargas.\n\nAs one of the \n, he was related to \n, \n, and \n.\n  He had two full sisters, Inés Pizarro y de Vargas and Isabel Pizarro y de Vargas, married to Gonzalo de Tapia.  Through his father, he was a second cousin of \n.\n\n\nStarting in 1532 and succeeding in 1533, Francisco Pizarro conquered the \n and claimed what we know today as Peru for Spain.\n In the 16th century the Incas were conquered by the \n, Hernando Pizarro, who was the brother of the chief commander of the conquest Francisco Pizarro, writes a letter to the royal audience of Santo Domino about the expedition. Hernando Pizarro wrote this letter on November 1533. Hernando Pizarro starts his letter by explaining how the government founded a town called San Miguel and then proceeded to search for the town of \n whose rulers have been fighting. In this letter, we get a better understanding of what type of person Hernando Pizarro was. In the letter, Hernando gives a description image of his surroundings while on the expedition \"The road over the mountains is a thing worth seeing, because, though the ground is so rugged, such beautiful roads could not in truth be found throughout Christendom. The greater part of them is paved. There is a bridge of stone or wood over every stream. We found bridges of network over a very large and powerful river, which we crossed twice, which was a marvelous thing to see.\"\n Hernando Pizarro was a very intellectual man with a great appreciation for his surroundings, one of the many reasons for why his part in conquering the \n with his brother, \n, was essential.\n\nUnlike his other brothers, he was born \n, and he was educated and gained influence in the Spanish court.  In 1530 Hernando departed for the \n with his half-brother, \n, and accompanied him during his conquests in \n.\n  In 1533, Hernando was sent back to Spain with the royal fifth for the Emperor, which consisted of \"a number of the most beautiful articles\" collected for \n's \n.\n\n\nHernando arrived \n on 9 January,\n 1534, proceeded to \n, and an audience with \n.  Hernando delivered the \n and recounted the Pizarro brothers' adventures.  Charles confirmed Francisco Pizarro's previous grants, extending them seventy \n further south, and then gave Francisco's partner, \n, a grant two hundred leagues further south.\n\n\nWhen he returned to Peru, he ruled with his other half-brothers (\n and \n) over the prized \n capital of \n.  Governing with an iron fist, he helped with the eventual suppression of Inca uprisings led by \n.\n\nAfter \n returned from \n from a fruitless gold-seeking expedition, he found that Hernando and his brothers were in control of Cuzco.  However, as he had not obtained any credit for having been Francisco Pizarro's main partner in discovering Peru, he decided to claim Cuzco as part of his share.  Almagro seized the city in 1537, capturing Hernando and Juan.\n Hernando was eventually released after negotiations between Almagro and Francisco, and in 1538 he and Gonzalo returned with an army to confront Almagro. In the ensuing \n, the Pizarros won a decisive victory, capturing Almagro and the city.\n\n\nThe execution of Almagro later that year and the general disorder caused by the Spanish infighting caused substantial fallout in the Spanish court.  Hernando was again called upon to leverage his royal contacts: in 1539 he returned to Spain to lobby in favor of the Pizarros.  Their perceived treachery was too great, however, and despite Hernando's bribery, he was imprisoned for the next twenty years,\n from June 1541 until May 1561, in the \n.\n   He then lived in his Trujillo palace until his death in 1578.\n\n\nIn 1552, Hernando married his niece, \n (she was the daughter of Francisco Pizarro and his Inca mistress \n) in Spain. Although born out of wedlock, she was legitimized by Imperial Decree.  They had five children. One of their sons, Francisco Pizarro y Pizarro, married twice and had offspring, the Marqueses de La Conquista. As a result, the Pizarro line survived Hernando's death, though currently it is extinct in male line.\n\nHis father was a son of Fernando Alonso Pizarro and wife Isabel de Vargas Rodríguez de Aguilar, paternal grandson of Fernando or Hernando Alonso de Hinojosa and wife Teresa Martínez Pizarro, and brother of Juan Pizarro, who died without issue in 1521, and Diego Fernández Pizarro, who married Marina López and had a son Fernando Pizarro López, who had a natural son named Diego Pizarro de Vargas, married to Juana Rodríguez de Bobadilla, with female issue in Portugal.\n\n"},

They brought much of the \"\n\" under the dominion of Spain and Portugal.\n\nAfter \n' arrival in the \n in 1492, the Spanish, usually led by \n from the west and south of Spain, began building a \n in the \n using colonies such as \n, \n, and \n as their main bases. From 1519 to 1521, \n led the \n, ruled by \n. From the territories of the \n, conquistadors expanded Spanish rule to northern \n and parts of what is now the southern and western \n, and from \n sailing the \n to the \n. Other conquistadors took over the \n after crossing the \n and sailing the Pacific to northern \n. From 1532 to 1572, \n succeeded in \n in a manner similar to Cortés. Subsequently, other conquistadores used Peru as a base for conquering much of \n and \n. Central \n, home of the \n was conquered by licentiate \n, and its northern regions were explored by \n, \n, \n, \n and others. For southwestern Colombia, \n, and \n, conquistadors from Peru combined parties with other conquistadors arriving more directly from the Caribbean and \n-\n respectively. All these conquests founded the basis for modern \n and the \n.\n\n conquistadors also made significant explorations into the \n, \n, the interior of \n, and the discovery and exploration of the Pacific Ocean. Conquistadors founded numerous cities, some of them in locations with pre-existing settlements, such as \n and \n. Conquistadors in the service of the \n led numerous conquests and visits in the name of the Portuguese Empire across \n and \n, going \"anticlockwise\" along the continent's coast right up to the \n, as well as commercial colonies in Asia, founding the origins of modern \n. Notable Portuguese conquistadors include \n who led conquests across \n, the \n, the \n, and \n; and \n who led conquests into \n.\n\nPortugal established a route to China in the early 16th century, sending ships via the southern coast of Africa and founding numerous coastal enclaves along the route. Following the discovery in 1492 by Spaniards of the New World with Italian explorer \n' first voyage there and the first \n of the world by \n in 1521, expeditions led by conquistadors in the 16th century established trading routes linking Europe with all these areas.\n\n\nThe Age of Discovery was hallmarked in 1519, shortly after the European discovery of the Americas, when Hernán Cortés began his conquest of the Aztec Empire.\n As the Spaniards, motivated by gold and fame, established relations and war with the Aztecs, the slow progression of conquest, erection of towns, and cultural dominance over the natives brought more Spanish troops and support to modern-day Mexico. As trading routes over the seas were established by the works of Columbus, Magellan, and Elcano, land support system was established as the trails of Cortés' conquest to the capital.\n\nHuman infections gained worldwide transmission vectors for the first time: from Africa and Eurasia to the Americas and \n.\n The \n, including \n, \n, and \n, led to the deaths of many indigenous inhabitants of the \n.\n\nIn the 16th century, perhaps 240,000 Spaniards entered American ports.\n By the late 16th century, gold and silver imports from the Americas provided one-fifth of Spain's total budget.\n\n\nContrary to popular belief, many conquistadors were not trained warriors, but mostly artisans, lesser nobility or farmers seeking an opportunity to advance themselves in the new world since they had limited opportunities in Spain.\n A few also had crude firearms known as \n. Their units (\n) would often specialize in forms of combat that required long periods of training that were too costly for informal groups. Their armies were mostly composed of Spanish troops, as well as soldiers from other parts of Europe and Africa.\n\nNative allied troops were largely infantry equipped with armament and armour that varied geographically. Some groups consisted of young men without military experience, \n who helped with administrative duties, and soldiers with military training. These native forces often included African slaves and Native Americans, some of whom were also slaves. They were not only made to fight in the battlefield but also to serve as interpreters, informants, servants, teachers, physicians, and scribes. \n and \n were Native American women slaves who were forced to work for the Spaniards.\n\n\nCastilian law prohibited foreigners and non-Catholics from settling in the New World. However, not all conquistadors were Castilian. Many foreigners \n their names and/or converted to Catholicism to serve the Castilian Crown. For example, \n (known as Juan de Fuca) was a Castilian of Greek origin who discovered the \n between \n and \n in 1592. German-born \n, Hispanicised as Nicolás de Federmán, was a \n in \n and Colombia. The Venetian \n was Sebastián Caboto, \n Hispanicised as Jorge de la Espira, Eusebio Francesco Chini Hispanicised as \n, \n was Wenceslao Linck, \n, was Fernando Consag, \n was Américo Vespucio, and the Portuguese \n was known as Alejo García in the Castilian army.\n\nThe origin of many people in mixed expeditions was not always distinguished. Various occupations, such as sailors, fishermen, soldiers and nobles employed different languages (even from unrelated language groups), so that crew and settlers of Iberian empires recorded as \n from Spain were actually using Portuguese, Basque, Catalan, Italian and \n languages, which were wrongly identified.\n\nCastilian law banned Spanish women from travelling to America unless they were married and accompanied by a husband. Women who travelled thus include María de Escobar, \n, Marina Vélez de Ortega, Marina de la Caballería, Francisca de Valenzuela, Catalina de Salazar. Some conquistadors married Native American women or had illegitimate children.\n\nEuropean young men enlisted in the army because it was one way out of poverty. Catholic priests instructed the soldiers in mathematics, writing, theology, Latin, Greek, and history, and wrote letters and official documents for them. King's army officers taught military arts. An uneducated young recruit could become a military leader, elected by their fellow professional soldiers, perhaps based on merit. Others were born into \n families, and as such they were members of the Spanish \n with some studies but without economic resources. Even some rich nobility families' members became soldiers or missionaries, but mostly not the firstborn heirs.\n\nThe two most famous conquistadors were \n who conquered the \n and \n who led the conquest of the \n. They were second cousins born in \n, where many of the Spanish conquerors were born.\n\nCatholic religious orders that participated and supported the exploration, evangelizing and pacifying, were mostly \n, \n, \n and \n, for example \n, \n, \n, \n or \n. In 1536, Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas went to \n to participate in a series of discussions and debates among the Bishops of the Dominican and Franciscan orders. The two orders had very different approaches to the conversion of the Indians. The Franciscans used a method of mass conversion, sometimes baptizing many thousands of Indians in a day. This method was championed by prominent Franciscans such as \n.\n\nThe conquistadors took many different roles, including religious leader, \n keeper, King or Emperor, deserter and \n warrior. \n was a Portuguese settler in the \n Indians. \n was a Maya war leader for Nachan can, Lord of \n. \n, who had taken holy orders in his native Spain, was captured by Maya lords too, and later was a soldier with Hernán Cortés. Francisco Pizarro had children with more than 40 women, many of whom were \n. The \n \n, \n, \n, \n and friar \n wrote about the Americas.\n\nAfter Mexico fell, Hernán Cortés's enemies \n, \n, \n and \n were mentioned in Cortés' fourth letter to the King in which he describes himself as the victim of a conspiracy.\n\nThe division of the booty produced bloody conflicts, such as the one between Pizarro and De Almagro. After present-day Peruvian territories fell to Spain, \n dispatched \n, \n, before they became enemies to the Inca Empire's northern city of \n to claim it. Their fellow conquistador \n, who had gone forth without Pizarro's approval, had already reached Quito. The arrival of \n from the lands known today as \n in search of Inca gold further complicated the situation for De Almagro and Belalcázar. De Alvarado left South America in exchange for monetary compensation from Pizarro. De Almagro was executed in 1538, by \n's orders. In 1541, supporters of \n assassinated Francisco Pizarro in Lima. In 1546, De Belalcázar ordered the execution of \n, who governed a neighbouring province in yet another land-related vendetta. De Belalcázar was tried in absentia, convicted and condemned for killing Robledo and for other offenses pertaining to his involvement in the wars between armies of conquistadors. \n was killed by his subordinate \n who crowned himself king while searching for \n. In 1544, Lope de Aguirre and Melchor Verdugo (a \n Jew) were at the side of Peru's first viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela, who had arrived from Spain with orders to implement the \n and suppress the \n. \n, \n of Francisco Pizarro, rose in revolt, killed viceroy \n and most of his Spanish army in the battle in 1546, and Gonzalo attempted to have himself crowned king.\n\nThe Emperor commissioned bishop \n to restore the peace, naming him president of the \n and providing him with unlimited authority to punish and pardon the rebels. Gasca repealed the \n, the issue around which the rebellion had been organized. Gasca convinced \n, explorer of Chile, \n another searcher for \n, and others that if he were unsuccessful, a royal fleet of 40 ships and 15,000 men was preparing to sail from \n in June.\n\n\n \n \n of Portugal, son of \n, became the main sponsor of exploration travels. In 1415, Portugal conquered \n, its first overseas colony.\n\nThroughout the 15th century, \n sailed the coast of Africa, establishing trading posts for \n such as firearms, spices, silver, gold, and \n crossing Africa and India. In 1434 the first consignment of \n was brought to \n; slave trading was the most profitable branch of Portuguese commerce until the Indian subcontinent was reached. Due to the importation of the slaves as early as 1441, the kingdom of Portugal was able to establish a number of population of slaves throughout the Iberia due to its slave markets' dominance within Europe. Before the Age of Conquest began, the continental Europe already associated darker skin color with slave-class, attributing to the slaves of African origins. This sentiment traveled with the conquistadors when they began their explorations into the Americas. The predisposition inspired a lot of the entradas to seek slaves as part of the conquest.\n\nAfter his father's death in 1479, \n married Isabella of Castile, unifying both kingdoms and creating the \n. He later tried to incorporate the kingdom of Portugal by marriage. Notably, Isabella supported Columbus's first voyage that launched the spanish conquistadors into action.\n\nThe Iberian Peninsula was largely divided before the hallmark of this marriage. Five independent kingdoms: Portugal in the West, Aragon and Navarre in the East, Castile in the large center, and Granada in the south, all had independent sovereignty and competing interests. The conflict between Christians and Muslims to control Iberia, which started with North Africa's Muslim invasion in 711, lasted from the years 718 to 1492.\n Christians, fighting for control, successfully pushed the Muslims back to Granada, which was the Muslims' last control of the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nThe marriage between Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabel of Castile resulted in joint rule by the spouses of the two kingdoms, honoured as the \"Catholic Monarchs\" by Pope Alexander VI.\n Together, the Crown Kings saw about the fall of Granada, victory over the Muslim minority, and expulsion or forcibly converted Jews and non-Christians to turn Iberia into a religious homogeneity.\n\nThe 1492 discovery of the \n by Spain rendered desirable a \n of the Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exploration. Thus dividing the world into two areas of exploration and colonization. This was settled by the \n (7 June 1494) which modified the delimitation authorized by \n in two \n issued on 4 May 1493. The treaty gave to Portugal all lands which might be discovered east of a \n drawn from the \n Pole to the \n, at a distance of 370 leagues (1,800 km) west of \n. Spain received the lands west of this line.\n\nThe known means of measuring \n were so inexact that the line of demarcation could not in practice be determined,\n subjecting the treaty to diverse interpretations. Both the Portuguese claim to Brazil and the Spanish claim to the Moluccas depended on the treaty. It was particularly valuable to the Portuguese as a recognition of their new-found,\n particularly when, in 1497–1499, Vasco da Gama completed the voyage to India.\n\nLater, when Spain established a route to the Indies from the west, Portugal arranged a second treaty, the \n.\n\n, established in 1509, was the first Spanish settlement on the island of \n, which the Spaniards called \n. The capital was in an unhealthy location\n and consequently moved around 1534 to the place they called \"Villa de Santiago de la Vega\", later named \n, in present-day \n.\n\n\nAfter first landing on \"\n\" in \n, Columbus found the island which he called \"Isla Juana\", later named Cuba.\n In 1511, the first \n of \n, \n founded the island's first Spanish settlement at Baracoa; other towns soon followed, including \n, which was founded in 1515.\n\nAfter he pacified \n, where the native Indians had revolted against the administration of governor \n, Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar led the conquest of Cuba in 1511 under orders from Viceroy \n and was appointed governor of the island. As governor he authorized expeditions to explore lands further west, including the 1517 \n to \n. \n, ordered expeditions, one led by his nephew, \n, to Yucatán and the Hernán Cortés expedition of 1519. He initially backed Cortés's expedition to Mexico, but because of his personal enmity for Cortés later ordered \n to arrest him. Grijalva was sent out with four ships and some 240 men.\n\n\nHernán Cortés, led an expedition (entrada) to Mexico, which included Pedro de Alvarado and Bernardino Vázquez de Tapia. The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native Tlaxcalan warriors led by Cortés and Xicotencatl the Younger captured the emperor Cuauhtemoc and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the Aztec Empire. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of Mexico City on the ruins of Tenochtitlan. The \n was one of the most significant events in world history.\n\nIn 1516, \n, discovered the \n formed by the \n of the \n and the \n.\n\nIn 1517, \n sailed from \n in search of slaves along the coast of \n.\n The expedition returned to Cuba to report on the discovery of this new land.\n\nAfter receiving notice from \n of gold in the area of what is now \n, the \n, \n, sent a larger force than had previously sailed, and appointed Cortés as Captain-General of the Armada. Cortés then applied all of his funds, mortgaged his estates and borrowed from merchants and friends to outfit his ships. Velásquez may have contributed to the effort, but the government of Spain offered no financial support.\n\n\n, Governor of the Island \n was descended from a \n's family. In 1519 Dávila founded \n, then in 1524 he founded Panama City and moved his capital there laying the basis for the exploration of South America's west coast and the subsequent \n. Dávila was a soldier in wars against Moors at \n in Spain, and in North Africa, under \n intervening in the Conquest of \n. At the age of nearly seventy years he was made commander in 1514 by Ferdinand of the largest Spanish expedition.\n\nDávila sent \n to explore northward, and \n to \n. In 1524 he sent another expedition with \n, executed there in 1526 by Dávila, by then aged over 85. Dávila's daughters married Rodrigo de Contreras and conquistador of Florida and Mississippi, the \n \n.\n\nDávila made an agreement with Francisco Pizarro and \n, which brought about the discovery of Peru, but withdrew in 1526 for a small compensation, having lost confidence in the outcome. In 1526 Dávila was superseded as Governor of Panama by \n, but became governor in 1527 of \n in Nicaragua.\n\nAn expedition commanded by Pizarro and his brothers explored south from what is today Panama, reaching Inca territory by 1526.\n After one more expedition in 1529, Pizarro received royal approval to conquer the region and be its viceroy. The approval read: \"In July 1529 the queen of Spain signed a charter allowing Pizarro to conquer the Inca. Pizarro was named governor and captain of all conquests in New Castile.\"\n The \n was established in 1542, encompassing all Spanish holdings in South America.\n\nIn early 1536, the Adelantado of \n, \n, arrived to \n, a city founded in 1525 by \n in modern-day Colombia, as governor. After some expeditions to the \n, Fernández de Lugo sent an expedition to the interior of the territory, initially looking for a land path to Peru following the \n. This expedition was commanded by Licentiate \n, who ended up discovering and conquering the indigenous \n, and establishing the \n, which almost two centuries would be a viceroyalty. Jiménez de Quesada also founded the capital of Colombia, \n.\n\n arrived again to the renamed \n, literally river of the silver, after the Incan conquest. He sought a way to transport the Potosi's silver to Europe. For a long time due to the Incan silver mines, \n was the most important site in Colonial Spanish America, located in the current \n in Bolivia\n and it was the location of the Spanish colonial mint. The first settlement in the way was the fort of \n, established in 1527 next to the \n. Buenos Aires was established in 1536, establishing the \n.\n\n\nAfricans were also conquistadors in the early conquest campaigns in the Caribbean and Mexico. In the 1500s there were enslaved black and free black\n sailors on Spanish ships crossing the Atlantic and developing new routes of conquest and trade in the Americas.\n After 1521, the wealth and credit generated by the acquisition of the Aztec Empire funded auxiliary forces of black conquistadors that could number as many as five hundred. Spaniards recognized the value of these fighters. \n\n\nOne of the black conquistadors who fought against the Aztecs and survived the destruction of their empire was \n. Born in Africa, Garrido lived as a young slave in Portugal before being sold to a Spaniard and acquiring his freedom fighting in the conquests of Puerto Rico, Cuba, and other islands. He fought as a free servant or auxiliary, participating in Spanish expeditions to other parts of Mexico (including Baja California) in the 1520s and 1530s. Granted a house plot in Mexico City, he raised a family there, working at times as a guard and town crier. He claimed to have been the first person to plant wheat in Mexico.\n\n\nSebastian Toral was an African slave and one of the first black conquistadors in the New World. While a slave, he went with his Spanish owner on a campaign. He was able to earn his freedom during this service. He continued as a free conquistador with the Spaniards to fight the Maya in Yucatán in 1540. After the conquests he settled in the city of Mérida in the newly formed colony of Yucatán with his family. In 1574, the Spanish crown ordered that all slaves and free blacks in the colony had to pay a tribute to the crown. However, Toral wrote in protest of the tax based on his services during his conquests. The Spanish king responded that Toral need not pay the tax because of his service. Toral died a veteran of three transatlantic voyages and two Conquest expeditions, a man who had successfully petitioned the great Spanish King, walked the streets of Lisbon, Seville, and Mexico City, and helped found a capital city in the Americas.\n\n\n was born West Africa and purchased by Portuguese traders from African slavers. Around 1530 he was purchased by Alonso Valiente to be a slaved domestic servant in Puebla, Mexico. In 1533, Juan Valiente made a deal with his owner to allow him to be a conquistador for four years with the agreement that all earnings would come back to Alonso. He fought for many years in Chile and Peru. By 1540, he was a captain, horseman, and partner in Pedro de Valdivia's company in Chile. He was later awarded an estate in Santiago; a city he would help Valdivia found. Both Alonso and Valiente tried to contact the other to make an agreement about Valiente's manumission and send Alonso his awarded money. They were never able to reach each other and Valiente died in 1553 in the Battle of Tucapel.\n\n\nOther black conquistadors include Pedro Fulupo, Juan Bardales, Antonio Pérez, and Juan Portugués. Pedro Fulupo was a black slave that fought in Costa Rica. Juan Bardales was an African slave that fought in Honduras and Panama. For his service he was granted manumission and a pension of 50 pesos. Antonio Pérez was from North Africa, and a free black. He joined the conquest in Venezuela and was made a captain. Juan Portugués fought in the conquests in Venezuela.\n\n\nDuring the 1500s, the Spanish began to travel through and colonize North America. They were looking for gold in foreign kingdoms. By 1511 there were rumours of \n to the northwest of \n. \n equipped three ships with at least 200 men at his own expense and set out from Puerto Rico on 4 March 1513 to Florida and surrounding coastal area. Another early motive was the search for the \n, or \"Cibola\", rumoured to have been built by Native Americans somewhere in the desert Southwest. In 1536 \n, the first documented European to reach the Colorado River, sailed up the Gulf of California and a short distance into the river's delta.\n\n\nThe \n were fur trading, fishing cod and whaling in Terranova (\n and \n) in 1520,\n and in Iceland by at least the early 17th century.\n They established whaling stations at the former, mainly in \n,\n and probably established some in the latter as well. In Terranova they hunted \n and \n, while in Iceland\n they appear to have only hunted the latter. The Spanish fishery in Terranova declined over conflicts between Spain and other European powers during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.\n\nIn 1524, the Portuguese \n, who had sailed in \n's fleet, explored Nova Scotia, sailing South through Maine, where he entered \n and the \n and eventually reached Florida in August 1525. As a result of his expedition, the 1529 \n world map outlined the East coast of North America almost perfectly.\n\n\nThe Spaniard \n was the leader of the \n of 600 men\n that between 1527 and 1535 explored the mainland of North America. From \n, on 15 April 1528, they marched through Florida. Traveling mostly on foot, they crossed Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, and Mexican states of \n, \n and \n. After several months of fighting native inhabitants through wilderness and \n, the party reached \n with 242 men. They believed they were near other Spaniards in Mexico, but there was in fact 1500 miles of coast between them. They followed the coast westward, until they reached the mouth of the \n near to \n.\n\n\nLater they were enslaved for a few years by various Native American tribes of the upper \n. They continued through Coahuila and \n; then down the Gulf of California coast to what is now \n, Mexico, over a period of roughly eight years. They spent years enslaved by the Ananarivo of the Louisiana \n. Later they were enslaved by the \n, the \n and others. In 1534 they escaped into the American interior, contacting other \n tribes along the way. Only four men, Cabeza de Vaca, \n, \n, and an \n Moroccan \n named \n, survived and escaped to reach \n. In 1539, Estevanico was one of four men who accompanied \n as a guide in search of the fabled \n, preceding \n. When the others were struck ill, Estevanico continued alone, opening up what is now New Mexico and Arizona. He was killed at the \n village of \n in present-day New Mexico.\n\n\nThe viceroy of \n \n, for whom is named the \n, commissioned several expeditions to explore and establish settlements in the northern lands of New Spain in 1540–1542. \n reached \n in central Kansas. \n explored the western coastline of \n in 1542–1543. Vázquez de Coronado's 1540–1542 expedition began as a search for the fabled Cities of Gold, but after learning from natives in New Mexico of a large river to the west, he sent \n to lead a small contingent to find it. With the guidance of Hopi Indians, Cárdenas and his men became the first outsiders to see the Grand Canyon.\n However, Cárdenas was reportedly unimpressed with the canyon, assuming the width of the Colorado River at six feet (1.8 m) and estimating 300-foot-tall (91 m) rock formations to be the size of a person. After unsuccessfully attempting to descend to the river, they left the area, defeated by the difficult terrain and torrid weather.\n\n\nIn 1540, \n and his fleet reached the mouth of the \n, intending to provide additional supplies to Coronado's expedition. Alarcón may have sailed the Colorado as far upstream as the present-day California–Arizona border. However, Coronado never reached the Gulf of California, and Alarcón eventually gave up and left. \n reached the delta in the same year, intending to establish contact with Alarcón, but the latter was already gone by the time of Díaz's arrival. Díaz named the Colorado River \n, while the name \n (\"Red River\") was first applied to a tributary of the Gila River.\n\nIn 1540, expeditions under Hernando de Alarcon and Melchior Diaz visited the area of \n and immediately saw the natural crossing of the Colorado River from Mexico to California by land as an ideal spot for a city, as the Colorado River narrows to slightly under 1000 feet wide in one small point. Later military expeditions that crossed the Colorado River at the \n include \n's (1774).\n\nThe marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville and Miguel Rodríguez, a white Segovian conquistador in 1565 in St. Augustine (Spanish Florida), is the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in the continental United States.\n\n\nThe \n explored New Mexico in 1581–1582. They explored a part of the route visited by Coronado in \n and other parts in the southwestern United States between 1540 and 1542.\n\nThe viceroy of New Spain Don \n sent another expedition in 1648 to explore, conquer and colonize the Californias.\n\nIn 1525, \n ordered an expedition led by friar \n to go to Asia by the western route to colonize the \n (known as Spice Islands, now part of Indonesia), thus crossing first the Atlantic and then the Pacific oceans. \n sailed to the Philippines in 1542–1543. From 1546 to 1547 \n worked in Maluku among the peoples of \n, \n, and \n, and laid the foundations for the Christian religion there.\n\nIn 1564, \n was commissioned by the viceroy of New Spain, \n, to explore the Maluku Islands where Magellan and Ruy López de Villalobos had landed in 1521 and 1543, respectively. The expedition was ordered by \n, after whom the \n had earlier been named by Villalobos. \n Legazpi established settlements in the East Indies and the \n in 1565. He was the first governor-general of the \n. After obtaining peace with various indigenous tribes, López de Legazpi made the Philippines the capital in 1571.\n\n\nThe Spanish settled and took control of \n in 1603 to trade spices and counter Dutch encroachment in the archipelago of Maluku. The Spanish presence lasted until 1663, when the settlers and military were moved back to the Philippines. Part of the Ternatean population chose to leave with the Spanish, settling near \n in what later became the \n. Spanish \n traveled across the Pacific Ocean between \n in Mexico and Manila.\n\nIn 1542, \n traversed the coast of California and named many of its features. In 1601, \n mapped the coastline in detail and gave new names to many features. \n, lost from the expedition led by Sebastián Vizcaíno, explored the Pacific coast as far north as \n in present-day \n.\n\n\nSince the 1549 arrival to Kagoshima (Kyushu) of a group of Jesuits with St. Francis Xavier missionary and Portuguese traders, Spain was interested in Japan. In this first group of Jesuit missionaries were included Spaniards Cosme de Torres and Juan Fernandez.\n\nIn 1611, Sebastián Vizcaíno surveyed the east coast of Japan and from the year of 1611 to 1614 he was ambassador of King Felipe III in Japan returning to Acapulco in the year of 1614.\n In 1608, he was sent to search for two mythical islands called Rico de Oro (island of gold) and Rico de Plata (island of silver).\n\n\nAs a seafaring people in the south-westernmost region of Europe, the Portuguese became natural leaders of exploration during the Middle Ages. Faced with the options of either accessing other European markets by sea, by exploiting its seafaring prowess, or by land, and facing the task of crossing \n and Aragon territory, it is not surprising that goods were sent via the sea to England, \n, Italy and the \n towns.\n\n\nOne important reason was the need for alternatives to the expensive eastern trade routes that followed the \n. Those routes were dominated first by the republics of \n and \n, and then by the Ottoman Empire after the conquest of \n in 1453. The Ottomans barred European access. For decades the Spanish Netherlands ports produced more revenue than the colonies since all goods brought from Spain, Mediterranean possessions, and the colonies were sold directly there to neighbouring European countries: wheat, olive oil, wine, silver, spice, wool and silk were big businesses.\n\n\nThe gold brought home from \n stimulated the commercial energy of the Portuguese, and its European neighbours, especially Spain. Apart from their religious and scientific aspects, these voyages of discovery were highly profitable.\n\nThey had benefited from Guinea's connections with neighbouring Iberians and north African Muslim states. Due to these connections, \n and experts in naval technology appeared in Portugal. Portuguese and foreign experts made several breakthroughs in the fields of mathematics, cartography and naval technology.\n\nUnder \n (1443–1481), surnamed the African, the \n was explored as far as Cape St. Catherine (\n),\n and three expeditions in 1458, 1461 and 1471, were sent to \n; in 1471 Arzila (\n) and Tangier were captured from the Moors. Portuguese explored the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans before the Iberian Union period (1580–1640). Under \n (1481–1495) the fortress of \n, the modern Elmina, was founded for the protection of the Guinea trade. \n, or Can, discovered the \n in 1482 and reached \n in 1486.\n\nIn 1483, Diogo Cão sailed up the uncharted \n, finding Kongo villages and becoming the first European to encounter the \n.\n\n\nOn 7 May 1487, two Portuguese envoys, \n and \n, were sent traveling secretly overland to gather information on a possible sea route to India, but also to inquire about Prester John. Covilhã managed to reach Ethiopia. Although well received, he was forbidden to depart. \n crossed the \n in 1488, thus proving that the Indian Ocean was accessible by sea.\n\nIn 1498, \n reached India. In 1500, \n discovered Brazil, claiming it for Portugal.\n In 1510, \n conquered \n in India, \n in the \n, and \n. The Portuguese sailors sailed eastward to such places as Taiwan, Japan, and the island of \n. Several writers have also suggested the Portuguese were the first Europeans to discover Australia and New Zealand.\n\n\n, in Cape Verde islands, who received the land as a grant from the crown, established a colony with Jews forced to stay on \n. \n island was settled in 1500 under a similar arrangement. Attracting settlers proved difficult; however, the Jewish settlement was a success and their descendants settled many parts of Brazil.\n\n\nFrom their peaceful settlings in secured islands along Atlantic Ocean (archipelagos and islands such as Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde, São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón) they travelled to coastal enclaves trading almost every goods of African and Islander areas like spices (hemp, opium, garlic), wine, dry fish, dried meat, toasted flour, leather, fur of tropical animals and seals, whaling ... but mainly ivory, black slaves, gold and hardwoods. They maintaining trade ports in Congo (M'banza), Angola, Natal (City of Cape Good Hope, in Portuguese \"Cidade do Cabo da Boa Esperança\"), Mozambique (Sofala), Tanzania (Kilwa Kisiwani), Kenya (Malindi) to Somalia. The Portuguese following the maritime trade routes of Muslims and Chinese traders, sailed the Indian Ocean. They were on \n since 1498 when \n reached Anjadir, Kannut, Kochi and \n.\n\nDa Gama in 1498 marked the beginning of Portuguese influence in Indian Ocean. In 1503 or 1504, \n became part of the \n when Captain Ruy Lourenço Ravasco Marques landed and demanded and received tribute from the sultan in exchange for peace.\n Zanzibar remained a possession of Portugal for almost two centuries. It initially became part of the Portuguese province of Arabia and Ethiopia and was administered by a governor general. Around 1571, Zanzibar became part of the western division of the Portuguese empire and was administered from Mozambique.\n It appears, however, that the Portuguese did not closely administer Zanzibar. The first English ship to visit Unguja, the \n in 1591, found that there was no Portuguese fort or garrison. The extent of their occupation was a trade depot where produce was purchased and collected for shipment to Mozambique. \"In other respects, the affairs of the island were managed by the local 'king,' the predecessor of the Mwinyi Mkuu of Dunga.\"\n This hands-off approach ended when Portugal established a fort on \n around 1635 in response to the Sultan of Mombasa's slaughter of Portuguese residents several years earlier.\n\nIn west Africa \n was founded some time after the arrival of the \n, in the pre-existing capital of the local dynasty ruling at that time (1483), in a city of the Luezi River valley. Portuguese were established supporting one Christian local dynasty ruling suitor.\n\nWhen \n was established the \n. By 1516, Afonso I sent various of his children and nobles to Europe to study, including his son Henrique Kinu a Mvemba, who was elevated to the status of bishop in 1518. Afonso I wrote a series of letters to the kings of Portugal \n and \n concerning to the behavior of the Portuguese in his country and their role in the developing \n, complaining of Portuguese complicity in purchasing illegally enslaved people and the connections between Afonso's men, Portuguese mercenaries in Kongo's service and the capture and sale of slaves by Portuguese.\n\n\nThe aggregate of Portugal's colonial holdings in India were \n. The period of European contact of \n began with the arrival of Portuguese soldiers and \n of the expedition of \n, the son of \n, in 1505.\n The Portuguese founded a fort at the port city of \n in 1517 and gradually extended their control over the coastal areas and inland. In a series of military conflicts, political manoeuvres and conquests, the Portuguese extended their control over the \n, including \n (1591),\n \n (1593), \n (1593), and \n (1594,)\n but the aim of unifying the entire island under Portuguese control failed.\n The Portuguese, led by \n, launched a full-scale military invasion of the \n in the \n of 1594. The invasion was a disaster for the Portuguese, with their entire army wiped out by Kandyan \n.\n\n\nMore envoys were sent in 1507 to Ethiopia, after \n was taken by the Portuguese. As a result of this mission, and facing Muslim expansion, Queen Regent \n sent ambassador \n to King \n and to the Pope, in search of a coalition. Mateus reached Portugal via Goa, having returned with a Portuguese embassy, along with priest \n in 1520. Francisco Álvares book, which included the testimony of Covilhã, the \n (\"A True Relation of the Lands of Prester John of the Indies\") was the first direct account of Ethiopia, greatly increasing European knowledge at the time, as it was presented to the pope, published and quoted by \n.\n\n\nIn 1509, the Portuguese under Francisco de Almeida won a critical victory in the \n against a joint \n and Arab fleet sent to counteract their presence in the \n. The retreat of the Mamluks and Arabs enabled the Portuguese to implement their strategy of controlling the Indian Ocean.\n\n\n set sail in April 1511 from Goa to Malacca with a force of 1,200 men and seventeen or eighteen ships.\n Following his \n of the city on 24 August 1511, it became a strategic base for Portuguese expansion in the East Indies; consequently the Portuguese were obliged to build a fort they named \n to defend it. That same year, the Portuguese, desiring a commercial alliance, sent an ambassador, \n, to the \n, where he was well received by King \n.\n In 1526, a large force of Portuguese ships under the command of \n was sent to conquer \n, where Sultan \n was based. Earlier expeditions by \n and \n had explored that part of the Indian Ocean, and discovered several islands new to Europeans. Mascarenhas served as Captain-Major of the Portuguese colony of Malacca from 1525 to 1526, and as \n of Goa, capital of the Portuguese possessions in Asia, from 1554 until his death in 1555. He was succeeded by \n, who served with the title of \"governor-general\".\n\n\nTo enforce a trade monopoly, \n, and \n in the \n, were seized by \n in 1507, and in 1507 and 1515, respectively. He also entered into \n with \n. In 1513 while trying to conquer \n, an expedition led by Albuquerque cruised the \n inside the \n, and sheltered at \n island. In 1521, a force under \n conquered \n, ushering in a period of almost eighty years of Portuguese rule of the Persian Gulf.\n In the Red Sea, \n was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under \n penetrated as far as \n.\n\nIn 1511, the Portuguese were the first Europeans to reach the city of \n by the sea, and they settled on its port for a commercial monopoly of trade with other nations. They were later expelled from their settlements, but they were allowed the use of \n, which was also occupied in 1511, and to be appointed in 1557 as the base for doing business with Guangzhou. The quasi-monopoly on foreign trade in the region would be maintained by the Portuguese until the early seventeenth century, when the Spanish and Dutch arrived.\n\nThe Portuguese \n explored the Indian Ocean in 1528, he explored the islands of \n, Mauritius, and \n, naming it the \n or \n, after his countryman Pedro Mascarenhas, who had been there before. The Portuguese presence disrupted and reorganised the Southeast Asian trade, and in eastern Indonesia they introduced Christianity.\n After the \n annexed \n in August 1511, one Portuguese diary noted 'it is thirty years since they became \n'–\n giving a sense of the competition then taking place between Islamic and European influences in the region. Afonso de Albuquerque learned of the route to the \n and other \"Spice Islands\", and sent an exploratory expedition of three vessels under the command of \n, Simão Afonso Bisigudo and \n.\n On the return trip, \n was shipwrecked at Hitu Island (northern \n) in 1512. There he established ties with the local ruler who was impressed with his martial skills. The rulers of the competing island states of \n and \n also sought Portuguese assistance and the newcomers were welcomed in the area as buyers of supplies and spices during a lull in the regional trade due to the temporary disruption of \n and \n sailings to the area following the 1511 conflict in Malacca. The spice trade soon revived but the Portuguese would not be able to fully monopolize nor disrupt this trade.\n\n\nAllying himself with Ternate's ruler, Serrão constructed a fortress on that tiny island and served as the head of a \n band of Portuguese seamen under the service of one of the two local feuding sultans who controlled most of the \n trade. Such an outpost far from Europe generally only attracted the most desperate and avaricious, and as such the feeble attempts at Christianization only strained relations with Ternate's Muslim ruler.\n Serrão urged \n to join him in Maluku, and sent the explorer information about the Spice Islands. Both Serrão and Magellan, however, perished before they could meet one another, with Magellan dying in battle in Macatan.\n In 1535 Sultan Tabariji was deposed and sent to Goa in chains, where he converted to Christianity and changed his name to Dom Manuel. After being declared innocent of the charges against him he was sent back to reassume his throne, but died en route at Malacca in 1545. He had however, already bequeathed the island of \n to his Portuguese godfather Jordão de Freitas. Following the murder of Sultan Hairun at the hands of the Europeans, the Ternateans expelled the hated foreigners in 1575 after a five-year siege.\n\nThe Portuguese first landed in \n in 1513, but it only became the new centre for their activities in Maluku following the expulsion from Ternate. European power in the region was weak and Ternate became an expanding, fiercely Islamic and anti-European state under the rule of Sultan Baab Ullah (r. 1570–1583) and his son Sultan Said.\n The Portuguese in Ambon, however, were regularly attacked by native Muslims on the island's northern coast, in particular Hitu which had trading and religious links with major port cities on Java's north coast. Altogether, the Portuguese never had the resources or manpower to control the local trade in spices, and failed in attempts to establish their authority over the crucial Banda Islands, the nearby centre of most nutmeg and mace production. Following Portuguese missionary work, there have been large Christian communities in eastern Indonesia particularly among the Ambonese.\n By the 1560s there were 10,000 Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon, and by the 1590s there were 50,000 to 60,000, although most of the region surrounding Ambon remained Muslim.\n\n\n was visited by the Portuguese between 1507 (by Diogo Fernandes Pereira) and 1513. The Portuguese took no interest in the isolated \n. Their main African base was in \n, and therefore the Portuguese navigators preferred to use the \n to go to India. The \n at the north proved to be a more practical port of call.\n\nBased on the \n, Manuel I claimed territorial rights in the area visited by \n in 1497 and 1498.\n To that end, in 1499 and 1500, the Portuguese mariner \n visited the northeast Atlantic coast and \n and the north Atlantic coast of \n, which accounts for the appearance of \"Labrador\" on topographical maps of the period.\n Subsequently, in 1501 and 1502 the \n brothers explored and charted Greenland and the coasts of present-day \n, claiming these lands as part of the \n. Whether or not the Corte-Reals expeditions were also inspired by or continuing the alleged voyages of their father, \n (with other Europeans) in 1473, to \n (\n), remains controversial, as the 16th century accounts of the 1473 expedition differ considerably. In 1520–1521, \n was granted \n rights to the inner islands of the \n. Accompanied by colonists from mainland Portugal and the Azores, he explored Newfoundland and \n (possibly reaching the \n on the \n), and established a fishing colony on \n, that would last some years or until at least 1570s, based on contemporary accounts.\n\n\nBrazil was claimed by Portugal in April 1500, on the arrival of the Portuguese fleet commanded by \n.\n The Portuguese encountered natives divided into several tribes. The first settlement was founded in 1532.\nSome European countries, especially France, were also sending excursions to Brazil to extract \n. Worried about the foreign incursions and hoping to find mineral riches, the Portuguese crown decided to send large missions to take possession of the land and combat the French. In 1530, an expedition led by \n arrived to patrol the entire coast, ban the French, and to create the first colonial villages, like São Vicente, at the coast. As time passed, the Portuguese created the Viceroyalty of Brazil. Colonization was effectively begun in 1534, when \n \n divided the territory into twelve hereditary captaincies,\n a model that had previously been used successfully in the colonization of the \n, but this arrangement proved problematic and in 1549 the king assigned a \n to administer the entire colony,\n \n.\n\nThe Portuguese frequently relied on the help of \n and European adventurers who lived together with the aborigines and knew their languages and culture, such as \n, who lived among the Guaianaz tribe near today's São Paulo, and \n, who lived among the Tupinamba natives near today's Salvador de Bahia.\n\nThe Portuguese assimilated some of the native tribes\n while others were enslaved or exterminated in long wars or by European diseases to which they had no immunity.\n By the mid-16th century, sugar had become Brazil's most important export\n and the Portuguese imported African slaves\n to produce it.\n\n was the third \n of Brazil in 1556, succeeding Duarte da Costa, in \n of \n when France founded several colonies.\nMem de Sá was supporting of \n priests, Fathers \n and \n, who founded \n in 1532, and \n, in 1554.\n\n tried to settle in present-day \n, from 1555 to 1567, the so-called \n episode, and in present-day \n, from 1612 to 1614 the so-called \n. Through wars against the French the Portuguese slowly expanded their territory to the southeast, taking \n in 1567, and to the northwest, taking \n in 1615.\n\n\nThe Dutch sacked \n in 1604, and temporarily captured the capital \n.\n\nIn the 1620s and 1630s, the \n established many trade posts or colonies. The Spanish silver fleet, which carried silver from Spanish colonies to Spain, were seized by \n in 1628. In 1629 \n and \n were established.\n In 1630 the West India Company conquered part of Brazil, and the colony of \n (capital Mauritsstad, present-day \n) was founded.\n\n prince of \n, was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1636 by the \n on recommendation of Frederick Henry. He landed at \n, the port of \n and the chief stronghold of the Dutch, in January 1637.\nBy a series of successful expeditions, he gradually extended the Dutch possessions from \n on the south to \n in the north.\n\nIn 1624 most of the inhabitants of the town \n (\n), in the future Dutch colony of Brazil were \n who had been banned by the \n to this town at the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. As some years afterward the Dutch in Brazil appealed to Holland for craftsmen of all kinds, many Jews went to Brazil; about 600 Jews left Amsterdam in 1642, accompanied by two distinguished scholars – \n and \n. In the struggle between Holland and Portugal for the possession of Brazil the Dutch were supported by the Jews.\n\nFrom 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more permanently in the \n and controlled a long stretch of the coast most accessible to Europe, without, however, penetrating the interior. But the colonists of the \n in Brazil were in a constant state of siege, in spite of the presence in Recife of \n as governor. After several years of open warfare, the Dutch formally withdrew in 1661.\n\nPortuguese sent military expeditions to the \n and conquered British and Dutch strongholds,\n founding villages and forts from 1669.\n In 1680 they reached the far south and founded \n on the bank of the \n, in the Eastern Strip region (present-day \n).\n\n\nIn the 1690s, gold was discovered by \n in the region that would later be called \n (General Mines) in current \n and \n.\n\nBefore the Iberian Union period (1580–1640), Spain tried to prevent Portuguese expansion into Brazil with the \n. After the Iberian Union period, the \n were settled by Portugal. This was disputed in vain, and in 1777 Spain confirmed Portuguese sovereignty.\n\nIn 1578, the Saadi \n \n, contemporary of Queen \n, defeated Portugal at the \n, beating the young king \n, a devout Christian who believed in the crusade to defeat Islam. Portugal had landed in North Africa after \n asked him to help recover the Saadian throne. Abu Abdallah's uncle, Abd Al-Malik, had taken it from Abu Abdallah with Ottoman Empire support. The defeat of Abu Abdallah and the death of Portugal's king led to the end of the Portuguese \n and later to the integration of Portugal and its empire at the \n for 60 years under Sebastian's uncle \n. Philip was married to his relative \n cousin of his father, due to this, Philip was \n and \n in a \n with Spain.\n\nAs a result of the Iberian Union, Phillip II's enemies became Portugal's enemies, such as the Dutch in the \n, England or France. The \n were clashes not only in English and Spanish ports or on the sea between them but also in and around the present-day territories of Florida, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, and Panama. War with the Dutch led to invasions of many countries in Asia, including Ceylon and commercial interests in Japan, Africa (\n), and South America. Even though the Portuguese were unable to capture the entire island of Ceylon, they were able to control its coastal regions for a considerable time.\n\nFrom 1580 to 1670 mostly, the \n in Brazil focused on slave hunting, then from 1670 to 1750 they focused on mineral wealth. Through these expeditions and the \n, \n expanded from the small limits of the \n to roughly the same borders as current Brazil.\n\nIn the 17th century, taking advantage of this period of Portuguese weakness, the Dutch occupied many Portuguese territories in Brazil. \n was appointed as the governor of the Dutch possessions in Brazil in 1637 by the \n. He landed at Recife, the port of Pernambuco, in January 1637. In a series of expeditions, he gradually expanded from Sergipe on the south to São Luís de Maranhão in the north. He likewise conquered the Portuguese possessions of \n, Saint Thomas, and \n and Angola. The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long lasting and troublesome to Portugal. The \n captured a large portion of the Brazilian coast including the provinces of \n, Pernambuco, \n, Rio Grande do Norte, \n, and \n, while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. The large area of Bahia and its city, the strategically important Salvador, was recovered quickly by an Iberian military expedition in 1625.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal re-established authority over its lost territories including remaining Dutch controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions.\n\n was established in Taiwan, first by Portugal in 1544 and later renamed and repositioned by Spain in \n. It became a natural defence site for the Iberian Union. The colony was designed to protect Spanish and Portuguese trade from interference by the Dutch base in the south of Taiwan. The Spanish colony was short-lived due to the unwillingness of Spanish colonial authorities in \n to defend it.\n\nWhile technological superiority, military strategy and forging local alliances played an important role in the victories of the conquistadors in the Americas, their conquest was greatly facilitated by Old World diseases: \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n and \n. The diseases were carried to distant tribes and villages. This typical path of disease transmission moved much faster than the conquistadors, so that as they advanced, resistance weakened.\n \n is commonly cited as the primary reason for the population collapse. The American natives lacked \n to these infections.\n\n\nWhen \n and the Spaniards first explored the \n Valley in 1540, in modern New Mexico, some of the chieftains complained of new diseases that affected their tribes. \n reported that in 1528, when the Spanish landed in Texas, \"half the natives died from a disease of the bowels and blamed us.\"\n When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Incan empire, a large portion of the population had already died in a \n epidemic. The first epidemic was recorded in 1529 and killed the emperor \n, the father of \n. Further epidemics of smallpox broke out in 1533, 1535, 1558 and 1565, as well as typhus in 1546, influenza in 1558, diphtheria in 1614 and measles in 1618.\n\n\nRecently developed \n evidence shows that the illness which reduced the population in Aztec Mexico was aided by a great drought in the 16th century, and which continued through the arrival of the Spanish conquest.\n This has added to the body of epidemiological evidence indicating that \n (\n name for \n) were indigenous fevers transmitted by rodents and aggravated by the drought. The \n killed an estimated 5 to 15 million people, or up to 80% of the native population. The cocoliztli epidemic from 1576 to 1578 killed an estimated, additional 2 to 2.5 million people, or about 50% of the remainder.\n\n\nThe American researcher \n said that 95% of the total population of the Americas died in the first 130 years,\n and that 90% of the population of the Inca Empire died in epidemics.\n Cook and Borah of the \n believe that the indigenous population in \n declined from 25.2 million in 1518 to 700,000 people in 1623, less than 3% of the original population.\n\n\nThe conquistadors found new animal species, but reports confused these with monsters such as giants, dragons, or ghosts.\n Stories about castaways on mysterious islands were common.\n\nAn early motive for exploration was the search for Cipango, the place where gold was born. Cathay and Cibao were later goals. The \n, or \"Cibola\", was rumoured to have been built by Native Americans somewhere in the desert Southwest.\n As early as 1611, Sebastián Vizcaíno surveyed the east coast of Japan and searched for two mythical islands called Rico de Oro ('Rich in Gold') and Rico de Plata ('Rich in Silver').\n\nBooks such as \n fuelled rumours of mythical places. Stories included the half-fabulous Christian Empire of \"\n\", the kingdom of the \n on the \"Western Nile\" (\n), the \n, cities of Gold in North and South America such as \n, \n, and \n, and wonderful kingdoms of the \n and women called \n. In 1542, \n reached the \n, naming it after a tribe of warlike women he claimed to have fought there. Others claimed that the similarity between \n and \n, the Spanish-language word for 'Jew' around 1500, revealed the indigenous peoples' origin. Portuguese traveller \n reported that some of the Lost Tribes were living among the \n. \n wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of \n to cure his aging.\n A similar account appears in \n's \n of 1551.\n Then in 1575, \n, a shipwreck survivor who had lived with the Native Americans of Florida for 17 years, published his memoir in which he locates the Fountain of Youth in Florida, and says that Ponce de León was supposed to have looked for them there.\n This land\n somehow also became confused with the \n or Boyuca mentioned by \n, although Solis's navigational data placed it in the \n.\n\nSir \n and some Italian, Spanish, Dutch, French and Portuguese expeditions were looking for the wonderful Guiana empire that gave its name to the present day countries of \n.\n\nSeveral expeditions went in search of these fabulous places, but returned empty-handed, or brought less gold than they had hoped. They found other \n such as silver, which was particularly abundant in \n, in modern-day Bolivia. They discovered new routes, \n, \n, crops, spices and other products. In the sail era knowledge of winds and currents was essential, for example, the \n long prevented Portuguese sailors from reaching India. Various places in Africa and the Americas have been named after the imagined cities made of gold, rivers of gold and precious stones.\n\nShipwrecked off \n in present-day Brazil, \n living among the Guaranís heard tales of a \"White King\" who lived to the west, ruling cities of incomparable riches and splendour. Marching westward in 1524 to find the land of the \"White King\", he was the first European to cross South America from the East. He discovered a great waterfall\n and the \n. He managed to penetrate the outer defences of the \n on the hills of the \n, in present-day \n, the first European to do so, eight years before Francisco Pizarro.\nGarcia looted a booty of silver. When the army of \n arrived to challenge him, Garcia then retreated with the spoils, only to be assassinated by his Indian allies near \n on the \n.\n\nThe Spanish discovery of what they thought at that time was India, and the constant competition of Portugal and Spain led to a desire for secrecy about every trade route and every colony. As a consequence, many documents that could reach other European countries included fake dates and faked facts, to mislead any other nation's possible efforts. For example, the \n refers to a famous \n error propagated on many maps during the 17th and 18th centuries, despite contradictory evidence from various explorers. The legend was initially infused with the idea that California was a terrestrial paradise, peopled by black \n.\n\nThe tendency to secrecy and falsification of dates casts doubts about the authenticity of many \n. Several historians\n  have hypothesized that John II may have known of the existence of Brazil and North America as early as 1480, thus explaining his wish in 1494 at the signing of the \n, to push the line of influence further west. Many historians suspect that the real documents would have been placed in the Library of Lisbon.\n Unfortunately, a fire following the \n destroyed nearly all of the library's records, but an extra copy\n available in Goa was transferred to Lisbon's Tower of Tombo, during the following 100 years. The Corpo Cronológico (Chronological Corpus), a collection of manuscripts on the Portuguese explorations and discoveries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, was inscribed on \n's \n in 2007 in recognition of its historical value \"for acquiring knowledge of the political, diplomatic, military, economic and religious history of numerous countries at the time of the Portuguese Discoveries.\"\n\n\nFerdinand II King of Aragon and Regent of Castile, incorporated the American territories into the Kingdom of Castile and then withdrew the authority granted to governor Christopher Columbus and the first conquistadors. He established direct royal control with the \n, the most important administrative organ of the \n, both in the Americas and in Asia. After unifying Castile, Ferdinand introduced to Castile many laws, regulations and institutions such as the \n, that were typical in Aragon. These laws were later used in the new lands.\n\nThe \n, created in 1512–1513, were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of settlers in Spanish colonial America, particularly with regards to \n. They forbade the maltreatment of indigenous people, and endorsed their conversion to Catholicism.\n\nThe evolving structure of colonial government was not fully formed until the third quarter of the 16th century; however, \n designated \n to study the problems related to the colonization process. Rodríguez de Fonseca effectively became minister for the Indies and laid the foundations for the creation of a colonial bureaucracy, combining legislative, executive and judicial functions. Rodríguez de Fonseca presided over the council, which contained a number of members of the \n (\n), and formed a \n of about eight counsellors. Emperor \n was already using the term \"\n\" in 1519.\n\nThe Crown reserved for itself important tools of intervention. The \"capitulacion\" clearly stated that the conquered territories belonged to the Crown, not to the individual. On the other hand, \n allowed the Crown to guide the Companies conquests to certain territories, depending on their interests. In addition, the leader of the expedition received clear instructions about their duties towards the army, the native population, the type of military action. A written report about the results was mandatory. The army had a royal official, the \"veedor\". The \"veedor\" or notary, ensured they complied with orders and instructions and preserved the King's share of the booty.\n\nIn practice the Capitán had almost unlimited power. Besides the Crown and the conquistador, they were very important the backers who were charged with anticipating the money to the Capitán and guarantee payment of obligations.\n\nArmed groups sought supplies and funds in various ways. Financing was requested from the King, delegates of the Crown, the nobility, rich merchants or the troops themselves. The more professional campaigns were funded by the Crown. Campaigns were sometimes initiated by inexperienced governors, because in \n, offices were bought or handed to relatives or cronies. Sometimes, an expedition of conquistadors were a group of influential men who had recruited and equipped their fighters, by promising a share of the booty.\n\nAside from the explorations predominated by Spain and Portugal, other parts of Europe also aided in colonization of the New World. King Charles I was documented to receive loans from the German \n to help finance the Venezuela expedition for gold.\n With numerous armed groups aiming to launch explorations well into the Age of Conquest, the Crown became indebted, allowing opportunity for foreign European creditors to finance the explorations.\n\nThe conquistador borrowed as little as possible, preferring to invest all their belongings. Sometimes, every soldier brought his own equipment and supplies, other times the soldiers received gear as an advance from the conquistador.\n\nThe \n, seamen of the \n–\n participated in Columbus's undertaking.\n They also supported the project economically, supplying money from their personal fortunes.\n\n\nSponsors included governments, the king, viceroys, and local governors backed by rich men. The contribution of each individual conditioned the subsequent division of the booty, receiving a portion the pawn (lancero, piquero, alabardero, rodelero) and twice a man on horseback (caballero) owner of a horse.\n Sometimes part of the booty consisted of women and/or slaves. Even the dogs, important weapons of war in their own right, were in some cases rewarded. The division of the booty produced conflicts, such as the one between Pizarro and Almagro.\n\nThough vastly outnumbered on foreign and unknown territory, Conquistadors had several military advantages over the native peoples they conquered, military strategies and tactics that were mostly learned from the 781 year war of the \n. \n\nOne factor was the ability of the conquistadors to manipulate the political situation between indigenous peoples and make alliances against larger empires. To beat the \n civilization, they supported one side of a civil war. The Spanish overthrew the \n civilization by allying with natives who had been subjugated by more powerful neighbouring tribes and kingdoms. These tactics had been used by the Spanish, for example, in the \n, the \n and \n. Throughout the conquest, the indigenous people greatly outnumbered the conquistadors; the conquistador troops never exceeded 2% of the native population. The army with which \n besieged \n was composed of 200,000 soldiers, of which fewer than 1% were Spaniards.\n\n\nSpanish and Portuguese forces were capable of quickly moving long distances in foreign land, allowing for speed of maneuver to catch outnumbering forces by surprise. Wars were mainly between clans, expelling intruders. On land, these wars combined some European methods with techniques from Muslim bandits in \n. These tactics consisted of small groups who attempted to catch their opponents by surprise, through an ambush.\n\nIn \n, \n resorted to attacking Arab merchant ships, which were generally unarmed trading vessels without heavy cannons.\n\nSpanish conquistadors in the Americas made extensive use of \n, \n, and \n, with \n becoming widespread only from the 1570s.\n A scarcity of firearms did not prevent conquistadors to pioneer the use of mounted arquebusiers, an early form of \n.\n In the 1540s \n's use of firearms in the \n prefigured the \n technique that developed in Europe many decades after.\n\n\nAnimals were another important factor for Spanish triumph. On the one hand, the introduction of the horse and other domesticated pack animals allowed them greater mobility unknown to the Indian cultures. However, in the mountains and jungles, the Spaniards were less able to use narrow Amerindian roads and bridges made for pedestrian traffic, which were sometimes no wider than a few feet. In places such as \n, \n and \n, the indigenous people learned horsemanship, cattle raising, and sheep herding. The use of the new techniques by indigenous groups later became a disputed factor in native resistance to the colonial and American governments.\n\n\nThe Spaniards were also skilled at breeding dogs for war, hunting and protection. The \n, \n,\n and \n they used in battle were effective as a psychological weapon against the natives, who, in many cases, had never seen domesticated dogs. Although some indigenous peoples did have domestic dogs during the conquest of the Americas, Spanish conquistadors used \n and other \n in battle against the \n, \n, and \n. These specially trained dogs were feared because of their strength and ferocity. The strongest big breeds of broad-mouthed dogs were \n for battle. These \n were used against barely clothed troops. They were armoured dogs trained to kill and disembowel.\n\n\nThe most famous of these dogs of war was a mascot of \n called \n, the first European dog known to reach North America;\n another famous dog called \n, the son of \n, and the first European dog known to see the Pacific Ocean, was a mascot of \n and accompanied him on several expeditions.\n\nThe successive expeditions and experience of the Spanish and Portuguese pilots led to a rapid evolution of European nautical science.\n\nIn the thirteenth century they were guided by the sun position. For \n like other Europeans, they used Greek tools, like the \n and \n, which they made easier and simpler. They also created the \n, or \n, for measuring at sea the height of the sun and other stars. The \n became a reference upon the arrival of \n and \n in the Southern hemisphere in 1471, starting its use in celestial navigation. The results varied throughout the year, which required corrections. To address this the Portuguese used the astronomical tables (\n), a precious tool for oceanic navigation, which spread widely in the fifteenth century. These tables revolutionized navigation, enabling \n calculations. The tables of the Almanach Perpetuum, by astronomer \n, published in Leiria in 1496, were used along with its improved astrolabe, by \n and \n.\n\nThe ship that truly launched the first phase of the discoveries along the African coast was the Portuguese \n. Iberians quickly adopted it for their merchant navy. It was a development based on African fishing boats. They were agile and easier to navigate, with a tonnage of 50 to 160 tons and one to three masts, with \n triangular sails allowing \n. The caravel particularly benefited from a greater capacity to \n. The limited capacity for cargo and crew were their main drawbacks, but have not hindered its success. Limited crew and cargo space was acceptable, initially, because as exploratory ships, their \"cargo\" was what was in the explorer's discoveries about a new territory, which only took up the space of one person.\n Among the famous caravels are \n and \n. Columbus also used them in his travels.\n\nLong oceanic voyages led to larger ships. \"Nau\" was the Portuguese archaic synonym for any large ship, primarily \n. Due to the piracy that plagued the coasts, they began to be used in the navy and were provided with cannon windows, which led to the classification of \"naus\" according to the power of its artillery. The \n or nau was a three- or four-\n ship. It had a high rounded \n with large \n, \n and \n at the stem. It was first used by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish. They were also adapted to the increasing maritime trade. They grew from 200 tons capacity in the 15th century to 500. In the 16th century they usually had two \n, stern castles fore and aft, two to four masts with overlapping sails. In India travels in the sixteenth century used carracks, large merchant ships with a high edge and three masts with square sails, that reached 2,000 tons.\n\nBesides coastal exploration, Portuguese ships also made trips further out to gather \n and \n information. These voyages revealed the archipelagos of \n where the Portuguese were defeated by native people in 1535, Madeira, the Azores, Cape Verde, Sao Tome, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n, \n Island and \n.\n\nThe knowledge of wind patterns and \n, the \n and the \n in the Atlantic, and the determination of latitude led to the discovery of the best ocean route back from Africa: crossing the Central Atlantic to the Azores, using the winds and currents that spin clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere because of \n and the effect of \n, facilitating the way to Lisbon and thus enabling the Portuguese to venture farther from shore, a manoeuvre that became known as the \n (\n). In 1565, the application of this principle in the Pacific Ocean led the Spanish discovering the \n trade route.\n\nIn 1339 \n of Majorca produced the \n map. Evidently drawing from the information provided in 1336 by \n sponsored by King \n. It showed \n island, named \n and marked by a Genoese shield, as well as the island of \n (\n) and \n (\n), although Dulcert also included some imaginary islands himself, notably \n, and three islands he names \n, \n and \n.\n\n\nMestre Jacome was a Majorcan cartographer induced by Portuguese prince \n to move to Portugal in the 1420s to train Portuguese map-makers in Majorcan-style cartography.\n 'Jacome of Majorca' is even sometimes described as the head of Henry's observatory and \"school\" at \n.\n\n\nIt is thought that \n, son of Jewish cartographer Abraham Cresques of \n in Majorca, and Italian-Majorcan \n were cartographers at the service of Prince Henry. Majorca had many skilled Jewish cartographers. However, the oldest signed Portuguese sea chart is a Portolan made by \n in 1485 representing the Western Europe and parts of Africa, reflecting the explorations made by \n. Reinel was also author of the first nautical chart known with an indication of latitudes in 1504 and the first representation of a \n.\n\nWith his son, cartographer \n and \n, they participated in the making of the atlas known as \"Lopo Homem-Reinés Atlas\" or \"\n\", in 1519. They were considered the best cartographers of their time. Emperor Charles V wanted them to work for him. In 1517 King \n handed Lopo Homem a charter giving him the privilege to certify and amend all \n needles in vessels.\n\n\nThe third phase of nautical cartography was characterized by the abandonment of \n's representation of the East and more accuracy in the representation of lands and continents. \n (Goa ≈1520 – ≈1580), produced work of extraordinary quality and beauty, giving him a reputation as one of the best cartographers of the time. Many of his charts are large scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},
{"title": "Grand Palace - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\nThe \n (\n: \n, \n) is a complex of buildings at the heart of \n, \n. The palace has been the official \n of the \n (and later Thailand) since 1782. The king, his \n, and his royal government were based on the grounds of the palace until 1925. King \n (Rama IX), resided at the \n and his successor King \n (Rama X) resides at the \n, both in the \n, but the Grand Palace is still used for official events. Several royal ceremonies and state functions are held within the walls of the palace every year. The palace is one of the most popular \n in Thailand, with over eight million people visiting each year.\n\n\nConstruction of the palace began on 6 May 1782, at the order of King \n (Rama I), the founder of the \n, when he moved the capital city from \n to Bangkok. \n\nThroughout successive reigns, many new buildings and structures were added, especially during the reign of King \n (Rama V). By 1925, the king, the Royal Family and the government were no longer permanently settled at the palace, and had moved to other residences. After the \n in 1932, all government agencies completely moved out of the palace.\n\nIn shape, the palace complex is roughly rectangular and has a combined area of 218,400 square metres (2,351,000 sq ft), surrounded by four walls. It is situated on the banks of the \n at the heart of the \n, today in the \n. The Grand Palace is bordered by \n and Na Phra Lan Road to the north, Maharaj Road to the west, \n to the east and Thai Wang Road to the south.\n\nRather than being a single structure, the Grand Palace is made up of numerous buildings, halls, pavilions set around open lawns, gardens and courtyards. Its asymmetry and eclectic styles are due to its organic development, with additions and rebuilding being made by successive reigning kings over 200 years of history. It is divided into several quarters: the \n; the Outer Court, with many public buildings; the Middle Court, including the Phra Maha Monthien Buildings, the Phra Maha Prasat Buildings and the Chakri Maha Prasat Buildings; the Inner Court and the Siwalai Gardens quarter. The Grand Palace is currently partially open to the public as a museum, but it remains a working palace, with several royal offices still situated inside.\n\nThe construction of the Grand Palace began on 6 May 1782, at the order of King \n (Rama I).\n Having seized the crown from King \n of \n, King Rama I was intent on building a \n for his new \n. He moved the seat of power from the city of \n, on the west side of the \n, to the east side at \n. The new capital city was turned into an artificial island when canals were dug along the east side. The island was given the name '\n'. The previous \n was the \n, constructed for King Taksin in 1768.\n The old royal palace in Thonburi was small and sandwiched between two temples; \n and \n, prohibiting further expansion.\n\n\nThe new palace was built on a rectangular piece of land on the very west side of the island, between \n to the south, \n to the north and with the Chao Phraya River on the west. This location was previously occupied by a \n, whom King Rama I ordered to relocate to an area south and outside of the city walls; the area is now \n.\n\n\nDesperate for materials and short on funds, the palace was initially built entirely out of wood, its various structures surrounded by a simple log \n. On 10 June 1782, the king ceremonially crossed the river from Thonburi to take permanent residence in the new palace. Three days later on 13 June, the king held an abbreviated \n, thus becoming the first monarch of the new \n.\n Over the next few years the king began replacing wooden structures with masonry, rebuilding the walls, forts, gates, throne halls and royal residences. This rebuilding included the royal chapel, which would come to house the \n.\n\n\nTo find more material for these constructions, King Rama I ordered his men to go upstream to the old capital city of \n, which was destroyed in 1767 during a \n. They dismantled structures and removed as many bricks as they could find, while not removing any from the temples. They began by taking materials from the forts and walls of the city. By the end they had completely leveled the old royal palaces. The bricks were ferried down the Chao Phraya by barges, where they were eventually incorporated into the \n and the Grand Palace itself.\n Most of the initial construction of the Grand Palace during the reign of King Rama I was carried out by conscripted or \n labour.\n After the final completion of the ceremonial halls of the palace, the king held a full traditional coronation ceremony in 1785.\n\n\nThe layout of the Grand Palace followed that of the \n at Ayutthaya in location, organization, and in the divisions of separate courts, walls, gates and forts.\n Both palaces featured a proximity to the river. The location of a pavilion serving as a landing stage for \n also corresponded with that of the old palace. To the north of the Grand Palace there is a large field, the \n (now called \n), which is used as an open space for royal ceremonies and as a parade ground. There was also a similar field in Ayutthaya, which was used for the same purpose. The road running north leads to the \n, the residence of the \n of Siam.\n\n\nThe Grand Palace is divided into four main courts, separated by numerous walls and gates: the Outer Court, the Middle Court, the Inner Court and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. Each of these court's functions and access are clearly defined by laws and traditions. The Outer Court is in the northwestern part of the Grand Palace; within are the royal offices and (formerly) state ministries.\n To the northeast is the \n, the royal chapel, and home of the Emerald Buddha. The Middle Court housed the most important \n and ceremonial throne halls of the king. The Inner Court, at the south end of the complex, was reserved only for females, as it housed the king's harem.\n\n\nDuring the reign of King \n (Rama II), the area of the Grand Palace was expanded southwards up to the walls of Wat Pho. Previously this area was home to offices of various palace officials. This expansion increased the area of the palace from 213,674 square metres (2,299,970 sq ft) to 218,400 square metres (2,351,000 sq ft). New walls, forts, and gates were constructed to accommodate the enlarged compound. Since this expansion, the palace has remained within its walls with new construction and changes being made only on the inside.\n\n\nIn accordance with tradition, the palace was initially referred to only as the \n (\n) or 'Royal Palace', similar to the old palace in Ayutthaya. However, during the reign of King \n (Rama IV) the name \n or 'Grand Palace' was first used in official documents. This change of name was made during the elevation of Prince Chutamani (the king's younger brother) to the title of Second King \n in 1851. The proclamation of his title described the royal palace as the 'supreme' (\n; Borom)\n and 'great' (\n; Maha)\n palace. This title was given in order to distinguish the palace from the Second King's palace (the Front Palace), which was described as the \n (\n) or the 'glorious' (\n; Bovorn) palace.\n\n\nThroughout the period of \n, from 1782 to 1932, the Grand Palace was both the country's administrative and religious centre.\n As the main residence of the monarch, the palace was also the seat of government, with thousands of inhabitants including guardsmen, servants, concubines, princesses, ministers, and courtiers. The palace's high whitewashed castellated walls and extensive forts and guard posts mirrored those of the walls of Bangkok itself, and thus the Grand Palace was envisioned as a city within a city. For this reason a special set of palace laws were created to govern the inhabitants and to establish hierarchy and order.\n\n\nBy the 1920s, a series of new palaces were constructed elsewhere for the king's use; these included the more modern \n, constructed in 1903, and \n in 1909. These other Bangkok residences began to replace the Grand Palace as the primary place of residence of the monarch and his court. By 1925 this gradual move out of the palace was complete. The growth and centralization of the Siamese state also meant that the various government ministries have grown in size and were finally moved out of the Grand Palace to their own premises. Despite this the Grand Palace remained the official and ceremonial place of residence as well as the stage set for elaborate ancient ceremonies of the monarchy. The end of the absolute monarchy came in 1932, when \n overthrew the ancient system of government and replaced it with a \n.\n\n\nToday the Grand Palace is still a centre of ceremony and of the monarchy, and serves as a museum and tourist attraction as well.\n\n\nThe Outer Court or \n (\n) of the Grand Palace is situated to the northwest of the palace (the northeast being occupied by the Temple of the Emerald Buddha). Entering through the main Visetchaisri Gate, the Temple of the Emerald Buddha is located to the left, with many public buildings located to the right.\n\n\nThese buildings include the headquarters and information centre of the Grand Palace and the \n. Other important buildings inside the court include the \n (\n), used for important receptions and meetings. The \n (\n) is an office building housing various departments of the Royal Household. The main office of the \n was also formerly located here. The Outer Court has a small museum called the \n. The Phimanchaisri Gate opens directly unto the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall and is the main portal from the Outer Court into the Middle Court.\n\n\nHistorically this court was referred to as \n (\n, literally \n), and also served as the seat of the royal government, with various ministerial offices, a theatre, stables for the king's elephants, barracks for the royal guards, the royal mint and an arsenal. By 1925, all government agencies and workers had vacated the site and all of the buildings were converted for use by the Royal Household.\n\n\nThe Temple of the Emerald Buddha or Wat Phra Kaew (\n) (known formally as Wat Phra Si Rattana Satsadaram, \n) is a royal chapel situated within the walls of the palace. Incorrectly referred to as a \n, it is in fact a chapel; it has all the features of a temple except for living quarters for monks.\n Built in 1783, the temple was constructed in accordance with ancient tradition dating back to \n, a royal chapel within the grounds of the royal palace at \n, and \n at \n. The famed \n is kept within the grounds of the temple.\n\n\nThe temple is surrounded on four sides by a series of walled cloisters, with seven different gates. Like those ancient royal temples of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya, the Wat Phra Kaew complex is separated from the living quarters of the kings. Within these walls are buildings and structures for diverse purposes and of differing styles, reflecting the changing architecture during the various reigns of the kings. Despite this, most of the buildings within adhere strictly to classical \n. The establishment of the Temple of the Emerald Buddha dates to the very \n itself.\n\n\nThe largest and most important court is the Middle Court or the \n (\n) is situated in the central part of the Grand Palace, where the most important residential and state buildings are located. The court is considered the main part of the Grand Palace and is fronted by the Amornwithi Road, which cuts right across from east to west. The court is further divided into three groups of '\n' (\n; \n; \n) and one Siwalai Garden quarter.\n\n\nThe \n (พระมหามณเฑียร) group of buildings are located roughly at the centre of the Middle Court, therefore at the very heart of the Grand Palace itself. The traditional Thai style building group is enclosed by a low wall, as this was once the residential and sleeping abode of kings.\n Thus it is considered the most important set of throne halls in the entire Grand Palace. All of the buildings within the Maha Monthien face north and are arranged from front to back with the public reception hall being at the front, ceremonial halls in the middle and residential halls at the back, all of them inter-connected to each other.\n\n\nAll Royal \n since that of King Rama II have taken place within the walls of this building group.\n Construction began in 1785 at the order of King Rama I, the original buildings only included the Chakraphat Phimarn Throne Hall and the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall. Later King Rama II carried out major constructions including the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall and other extensions. Later in his reign he added the Sanam Chan Pavilion and the Narai Chinese Pavilion. King \n (Rama III) renamed the buildings from \n (meaning 'Abode of the \n') to \n (meaning 'Great Royal Residence'). He carried out major renovations and spent most of his reign residing in these buildings. King Rama IV later added two arch-ways at the north and west side of the walls called the Thevaphibal and Thevetraksa Gate respectively. King \n (Rama VI) added two portico extensions to eastern and western sides of the Amarin Winitchai Hall.\n Since then most buildings in its original plan remain, with occasional renovations being made before important anniversaries such as the Bangkok Bicentennial Celebrations in 1982. Except for the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall, the rest of the complex is closed to the public.\n\n\nThe Thevaphibal Gate is the central entrance to the hall, however the central doorway is reserve exclusively for use by the king, others must enter through the two other doors on either side. The gate is guarded by Chinese-style statues, including mythical warriors and lions. The gate is topped by three Thai-style spires covered in Chinese ceramics.\n\n\nThe \n (\n) or, in brief, the \n (\n) is the northernmost and forward building of the Maha Monthien buildings, It is also perhaps the most important. The throne hall was constructed in Thai style as a royal audience chamber, for receiving foreign ambassadors and for conducting important state businesses and ceremonies.\n\n\nThe large throne hall stands on a 50 cm high base, the roof is covered in green and orange tiles. The \n is decorated with a mural depicting the god \n. The main central door is reserved for use by royalty, while others must enter through the adjacent side doors. Within the hall there are two rows of square columns, five on the left and six on the right, adorned with Thai floral designs. The coffered ceiling is decorated with glass mosaic stars.\n\n\nAt the back of the hall is the \n \n (\n; \n), flanked by two gilded seven tiered umbrellas. The throne is shaped like a boat with a spired \n (\n) in the middle. This elevated pavilion represents \n, the centre of \n and \n \n.\n The throne is decorated with coloured enamels and stones as well as \n and \n figures. The \n was once used for giving royal audiences.\n\n\nIn the front of throne sits another, called the \n Throne (\n). The throne is topped by the massive \n, an important symbol of \n. The different tiers represents the king's power and prestige which extends in eight directions: the four \n and the four sub cardinal directions. The final and ninth tier represents the central direction descending into the earth. These giant umbrellas usually deposited above important royal thrones, and out of the seven of which are currently in Bangkok, six of these umbrellas are situated within the vicinity of the Grand Palace and another is situated above the throne within the \n of the Dusit Palace. The throne is made up of multi-layered squared platforms with a seat in the middle. The throne is used for the first royal audience of each king's reign and for annual birthday celebrations and other royal receptions. It was from this throne that King Rama II received \n (the first British Envoy to Siam in almost 200 years) in 1821. Crawfurd was sent to Bangkok by the \n \n to negotiate a trade treaty.\n\n\nDirectly behind is the \n (\n). The rectangular-shaped hall is a ceremonial functions hall, where the most important religious and state ceremonies are held. It is the main venue where royal coronations are performed at the beginning of each king's reign, the last coronation ceremony held here was on 4 May 2019 for King Rama X. Formerly the hall was a private reception hall and living space of King Rama I. He often hosted meetings and dinners for his closest ministers and other trusted courtiers here. After his death the hall was converted into a ceremonial space. The long rectangular hall is decorated in rich murals depicting scenes from Buddhist and \n.\n\n\nThe hall houses two thrones. The \n Throne (\n; \n) or the Octagonal Throne is situated to the eastern part of the hall. This unusually shaped wooden throne is in the form of an \n and is decorated with golden lacquer, topped by a white seven-tiered umbrella. It is used during the first part of the \n, where the king is anointed with holy water, just prior to the crowning ceremony; all Chakri kings have gone through this ancient ritual. Once the king is anointed he is able to sit under the \n as a fully sovereign king.\n\n\nAcross the hall to the western side is the \n Throne (\n; \n). The throne is a chair with a footstool (more akin to its European counterparts) with two high tables to its sides. The throne is topped by another Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella. This throne is used during the main part of the coronation ceremony, where the King is presented with the various objects, which make up the \n. The king will crown himself, then be ceremonially presented with the objects of the regalia by the \n. These include: the \n, the \n, the \n, the Royal Flywhisk, the Royal Fan and the Royal Slippers.\n\n\nApart from being the setting of these important ceremonies, the hall houses the \n figure. This figure was created during the reign of King Rama IV to symbolise and embody the Kingdom (of Siam), its well-being and safety. It exists as the personification of the nation to be used as a \n for worship. The golden figure depicts a standing deity, dressed in royal regalia, wearing a crown and holding a sword in its right hand. The figure is about 8 inches tall, and is housed in a Chinese-style cabinet in the middle of the Phaisan Thaksin Hall facing south. There are also other figures of the same scale depicting other Hindu gods and goddesses. The figure was once worshipped almost daily; today however religious ceremonies are only held to worship the figure during times of great crisis.\n\n\nThe \n (\n; \n) is situated behind the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall and is at the very centre of the Maha Monthien buildings. The hall was built during the reign of King Rama I as the \n and sleeping quarter of the monarch, and is the inner most part of the Grand Palace.\n The residential hall was formed out of three identical rectangular buildings, all inter-connected to each other. The middle section of the residential hall (out of the three), is a reception room while the other two sections, to the east and west, are divided into the personal apartments of the king. The east section is the primary \n of the monarch; the hall is divided into two rooms by a golden screen. The northern room contains a \n originally belonging to King Rama I; above this bed hangs a Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella. The southern room contains the dressing and privy chamber, above which hangs another Nine-tiered Umbrella. The west section was used as a multi-purpose hall for minor ceremonies and audiences; however in the reign of King Rama III the hall was converted into a bedroom. After his death it became the storage place for the various weapons and accoutrements of the monarch. The Royal Regalia of Thailand is kept here.\n\n\nWhen the Chakraphat Phiman Hall was first built it was entirely roofed with palm leaves; later these were replaced with ceramic tiles, then with glazed tiles during the reign of King Rama V. There is a tradition that no uncrowned kings are allowed to sleep within this hall. However once they were crowned they were required to sleep there, if only for a few nights, literally on the bed of their forefathers.\n In 1910, prior to his coronation, King Rama VI had a well-concealed modern toilet installed near the bedchamber.\n The king spent many nights here near the end of his life and died here in 1925. King \n (Rama VII) and King Rama IX only spent a few nights here after their respective coronations in accordance with tradition.\n\n\nBetween the Chakraphat Phiman and Phaisan Thaksin Halls is a small Front Reception Hall, where the king could receive courtiers while sitting on a small platform. There are two doors on either side of the platform leading into the royal apartments behind. To the rear and south of the Chakraphat Phiman Hall is the Back Reception Hall. This rear hall is  flanked by two residential halls. These are reserved for members of the \n and royal consorts from the Inner Court. They are called: \n Hall (พระที่นั่งเทพสถานพิลาศ) (to the east) and the \n Hall (พระที่นั่งเทพอาสน์พิไล; \n) (to the west).\n\n\nApart from these grand state buildings, there are also several minor structures and pavilions surrounding the Phra Maha Monthien structures. These include four smaller halls at the sides of the Amarin Winitchai Throne hall.\n\n\nAside the wall to the northwest is the \n (พระที่นั่งดุสิตาภิรมย์; \n). Built on a raised platform, the one-story hall was used as a robing chamber for the king when arriving and departing the palace either by \n or by elephant.\n Hence the elephant-mounting platform to the west and a palanquin-mounting platform to the north. At first the structure was an open pavilion; the walls covered with rich murals were added later by King Rama III. The entrance is situated to the east and is lined with steps leading from the Amarin Winitchai Throne Hall. The hall is the only structure within the Grand Palace with exterior decorations. The golden lacquer and blue glass mosaic depicts angels carrying a sword.\n\n\nTo the southeast is the \n (พระที่นั่งราชฤดี; \n), a Thai-style pavilion constructed during the reign of King Rama VI as an outdoor audience chamber.\n The pavilion was constructed for use especially during the birthday celebrations of the king. Originally King Rama IV had a two-story, European-style building constructed. Its purpose was to display gifts from foreign nations; however when this building became dilapidated King Rama V replaced it with a Chinese-style pavilion which was again dismantled and rebuilt. The present pavilion measures 12 by 7.80 metres (39.4 ft × 25.6 ft). The \n are decorated with a gilded figures of \n on a \n against a white mosaic background.\n\n\nThe southwest structure is the \n (พระที่นั่งสนามจันทร์). Built during the reign of King Rama II, the pavilion is a \n with a raised platform inside.\n King Rama II used the pavilion for relaxation and for sitting when supervising construction projects. Measuring only 3.30 by 4.50 metres (10.8 ft × 14.8 ft), the pavilion was portable and could be moved to different sites. The wooden pediments are decorated with gilded carvings and glass mosaic in a floral design with Chinese and Western influences. The eight columns are inlaid with glass mosaic. The inner platform is decorated with black lacquer and glass mosaic. The top of the platform is made out of a single panel of teak measuring 1.50 by 2 metres (4.9 ft × 6.6 ft). The pavilion was strengthened and given a marble base by King Rama IX in 1963.\n\n\nTo the northeast is the \n (หอศาสตราคม; \n) or the \n (หอพระปริตร), The hall is the same size as the Dusidaphirom Hall and the two appear to have been constructed concurrently. In accordance with ancient tradition, the hall was built for the use of \n monks to create \n, which was then sprinkled around the palace ground every evening; this practice was discontinued during the reign of \n for financial reasons. Currently the ritual is only practiced during Buddhist holy days by Mon monks from \n. The hall is divided into two rooms; the northern room is a prayer and ritual room for monks, including closets built into the walls for religious texts. The southern room is a storage room for \n and religious artifacts.\n\n\nDuring times of war, the potency of weapons was enhanced by the holy water in a special ceremony. The weapons and special amulets were then distributed to soldiers before battle. As a result of this function the windows and doors of the hall are decorated with depictions of ancient weapons.\n\n\nOn each side of the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall is a Buddha image hall. On the east side is the \n (หอพระสุราลัยพิมาน; \n), which then connects to the Dusitsasada Gate. The Ho Suralai Phiman is a small Thai-style building which is attached to the Phaisan Thaksin Throne Hall through a short \n. The hall houses important and valuable Buddha images and figures, including one representing each and every reign of the Chakri dynasty. Some relics of the \n are also reportedly kept here.\n\n\nThe \n (หอพระธาตุมณเฑียร) is located to the west side of the Phaisan Thaksin Hall and is also connected by a corridor in symmetry to the Suralai Phiman on the other side. The Phra That Montein hall contains several small gilded \n containing the \n of Royal ancestors. Originally named Ho Phra Chao, the name was changed by King Rama II, who installed several valuable and ancient Buddha images in 1812. King Rama III and King Rama IV also have their own Buddha images installed here and carried out extensive renovations to the interior and exterior.\n\n\nThe Phra Thinang Chakri Maha Prasat buildings are composed of nine major and minor halls, structured in a similar scheme to the Maha Monthien Halls from north to south, however the two building groups contrasts greatly in styles. This group of palaces is situated at the centre, between the Maha Montein and Maha Prasat groups.\n The whole of the Chakri Maha Prasat group was the work of King Rama V and foreign architects in the 19th century. During the reign of King Rama I the area was once an expansive garden, later named \n (สวนซ้าย) or 'Left Garden', the twin of \n (สวนขวา) or right garden, now the Siwalai Gardens. The two gardens were named according to their location on the left and the right of the Maha Monthien buildings. During the reign of King Rama III a new residential pavilion called \n (พระตำหนักตึก) was constructed for his mother, Princess Mother \n. The new residence was composed of several low-lying buildings and pavilions. King Rama IV expanded the residence and gave it to his consort Queen \n. Within these buildings King Rama V was born (in 1853) and lived as a child.\n\n\nWhen King Rama V ascended the throne in 1868, he decided to build a new group of grander throne halls to replace the old structures. The first phase of construction began in 1868, then again in 1876, and the final phase between 1882 and 1887. King Rama V resided in the palace until 1910 when he gradually moved to the new Dusit Palace, to the north of the Grand Palace.\n King Rama VI occasionally stayed in the palace; however he preferred his other residences in the country. By the reign of King Rama VII the buildings were in dire need of renovations, but due to economic constraints only the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall was renovated. This work was carried out by Prince \n, an architectural graduate of the \n in \n. Many of his works can still be seen today. During the reign of King Rama IX many of the buildings once more became so dilapidated that they needed to be demolished altogether. In their stead new halls were constructed in 2004 to replace them.\n\n\nFormerly the site hosted eleven different residential halls and pavilions; in 2012 only three are left, although they have been completely reconstructed: The Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall, the Moon Satharn Borom Ard Hall and the Sommuthi Thevaraj Uppabat Hall. Behind these structures lie the grand Borom Ratchasathit Mahoran Hall, which has been recently rebuilt. None of the rooms are open to the public, as state functions are still carried out within. The \n occurs at the front courtyard every two hours.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งจักรีมหาปราสาท; \n) is situated on the northernmost part of the Phra Thinang Chakri group. The throne hall forms the front or the façade of the entire building group. In front of the throne hall is the Rathakit Field; on either side of the throne hall are the Phrom Sopha Gates. The throne hall is constructed in an eclectic style, a blend of \n and European (more specifically \n) styles. The lower part of the structure is European, while the upper part is in Thai-styled green and orange tiled roofs and gilded \n or \n.\n\n\nAfter a trip to \n and \n, in the \n (present day \n) in 1875, King Rama V brought back with him two Englishmen, the architect \n and his helper \n to design and construct the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall.\n Construction began on 7 May 1876. At first the King wanted an entirely European structure with domes. However at the insistence of \n (Chuang Bunnag), his \n, the King decided to add the gilded spires and Thai roofs. In 1878 the King personally supervised the raising of the final central spire of the building. The throne hall was completed in 1882, on the centenary of the House of Chakri and the Grand Palace. Thus the new throne hall was given the name \n, meaning literally 'the seat of the Chakris'.\n\n\nThe throne hall was constructed as part of a building group in a rotated 'H' shape plan, with two parallel buildings running on an east to west axis. In between is an intersecting hall, with an axis running north to south. The northerly end of the structure is the Chakri Maha Prasat Throne Hall; all other buildings are hidden behind it. The throne hall consists of three storeys, with three seven tiered prasats on each of the three major pavilions along the axis. The central pavilion with its portico and roof extensions is taller and larger than the other two on the sides.\n Owing to a mix of Thai and European styles, the exterior decoration is a mixture of orders and does not follow strict classical lines. The Thai roofs are decorated with the same green and orange tiles as the other throne halls, in order for the new building to blend in harmoniously with the existing skyline. The external pediments and gates of the throne hall are decorated with the emblem of the Chakri dynasty, an intertwined \n and \n. Above the middle floor windows the western style \n of Siam is used. On the semi-circular pediment of the central hall there is also a portrait of King Rama V.\n\n\nThe incongruous make-up between the Western lower half and Thai roof has been compared with a \n (Western) lady clothed in \n while wearing a Thai crown. The symbolism of this juxtaposition emphasises the superiority of Thai architecture (a crown upon the head) over that of the West (the lower half of the body).\n This stylistic innovation was more than an artistic coincidence, as it was supposed to convey a significant political message of Siamese resistance to Western imperialism, both in terms of sovereignty and style. From another perspective, the building itself epitomizes the internal political struggle between the ideas of Westernization and modernity (led by King Rama V) and those of the traditional ruling elites (as espoused by some of his early ministers).\n\n\nWithin the interior, the upper and middle floors are State floors; they are divided into several reception rooms, throne rooms and galleries, complete with royal portraits of every \n (including Second King \n) and \n. In the east gallery are Buddhist images and other religious images, while to the west are reception rooms for State guests and other foreign dignitaries. In other parts of the throne hall there are also libraries and rooms where the ashes of kings (Rama IV to Rama VIII) and their queens are housed.\n Many of the European-made \n inside the Hall initially belonged to Chao Phraya Si Suriyawongse; however they proved too big for his own residence and he eventually gave them to King Chulalongkron as gifts. The throne hall was also the first structure in Thailand in which electricity was installed, at the insistence of Prince \n. The lower floor or ground floor is reserved for servants and the \n. Currently there is also a museum displaying old weapons.\n\n\nInside the main hall (throne room), situated at the very centre of the Chakri Maha Prasat Hall, is the \n Throne (พระที่นั่งพุดตานถม; \n), a chair on a raised platform. The Throne is flanked by two seven-tiered umbrellas, while the throne itself is topped by a Royal Nine-Tiered Umbrella. Behind the throne is a tapestry depicting a fiery intertwined \n and \n, or the 'Chakri', the emblem of the dynasty. The throne has been used by the king during important state occasions, such as the welcoming or accrediting of foreign diplomats and missions. The room itself has also been used by King Rama IX to welcome foreign dignitaries and heads of state, such as Queen \n, President \n and Pope \n.\n Recently the King welcomed more than 21 world leaders inside the room during the \n (APEC Summit) held in Bangkok in 2003.\n The wall of the throne room is decorated with four paintings depicting important scenes in the history of Thai foreign relations. On the east wall hang two paintings, titled 'Queen Victoria receiving King Mongkut's Ambassador' and 'King Louis XIV receiving the Ambassador of King Narai of Ayutthaya in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles'. On the west wall hang 'King Mongkut receiving British Envoy Sir John Bowring' and 'Napoleon III receiving the Siamese Ambassadors at Fontainbleau'.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งมูลสถานบรมอาสน์; \n) is situated behind the Chakri Maha Prasat Hall to the east side and was built as a separate wing in 1869.\n The hall encompasses the original area where King Rama V was born and had lived as a child. Previously King Rama I had the area set aside as a small \n garden. Currently the hall is set out as a small banqueting and reception venue.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งสมมติเทวราชอุปบัติ; \n) is situated on the opposite side of the Moon Santharn Borom Ard Hall, to the west of the Chakri Maha Prasat Hall. It was built in 1868.\n The hall is divided into several state rooms for use by the king: there is a reception room and a council room. It was in this hall on 12 July 1874 that King Rama V stated to his ministers his \n.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งบรมราชสถิตยมโหฬาร; \n) is a large banquet hall at the very back of the Chakri Maha Prasat group. It was formerly the Damrong Sawad Ananwong Hall and the Niphatpong Thawornwichit Hall. The two halls were built by King Rama V as banqueting halls to host foreign guests and dignitaries. By the reign of King Rama IX, the building was so run down that the king ordered it to be demolished.\n Construction of a new hall began in 1996, but was interrupted by the \n; it eventually resumed on 1 April 2004. The new throne hall was built on a raised platform and is composed of several interconnected buildings forming two internal courtyards. These rooms function as a new banqueting hall and are used for important state functions. On 13 June 2006, the hall welcomed the royal representatives of 25 monarchies worldwide for the celebration of \n. These guests included 12 ruling monarchs, 8 royal consorts and 7 crown princes.\n\n\nThe \n (พระมหาปราสาท) group of buildings is situated at the westernmost part of the Middle Court.\n The main buildings within this area date from the reign of King Rama I and contain some of the oldest existing edifices within the Grand Palace. The entire throne hall group is contained within a walled and paved courtyard. Similarly to the other two groups, the Maha Prasat buildings were constructed, embellished and refurbished over successive kings' reigns. The buildings form a single axis from north to south, with the public throne hall to the front and residential halls behind. Surrounding them are lesser function halls and pavilions for use by the king and his court.\n\n\nAfter the construction of the Grand Palace, King Rama I ordered that a copy of the ancient \n (พระที่นั่งสรรเพชญมหาปราสาท) should be built at the same site. The Hall was originally located at the old palace in Ayutthaya, which had been destroyed 15 years earlier.\n This new throne hall was given the name \n (พระที่นั่งอมรินทราภิเษกมหาปราสาท; \n). Construction began in 1782 and finished in 1784. This was the hall where King Rama I celebrated his full coronation ceremony. However, in 1789 the building was struck by lightning and burnt to the ground. In its place King Rama I ordered the construction of a new hall under a different design and name.\n\n\nAs a result of this disaster, King Rama I predicted that the Chakri dynasty would last only 150 years from its foundation.\n This prophecy was recorded in the diary of a contemporary princess; after reading it many years later, King Rama V remarked that 150 years was too short and that the princess must have inadvertently dropped a nought. The prophecy resurfaced in the minds of many people when only three months after the dynasty's 150th anniversary celebrations the \n occurred. The revolution replaced the absolute monarchy of the Chakri kings with a constitutional monarchy under Siam's \n.\n\n\nTwo new halls were then built, the Dusit Maha Prasat and the Phiman Rattaya, each being designated for either ceremonial or residential use. Since then no coronations have been held inside. Upon the death of King Rama I, the hall was used for his official \n. It has since become a custom that the remains of kings, queens and other high-ranking members of the royal family are to be placed in the hall for an official mourning period.\n\n\nThe entrance to this group of buildings is through one of the three gates at the northern end of the wall. These gates are decorated with Chinese porcelain in floral patterns. Only the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall is open to the public.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งดุสิตมหาปราสาท) dominates the Maha Prasat group. It was built on a symmetrical cruciform plan and the roof is topped with a tall gilded spire. The hall is considered an ideal example of traditional Thai architecture. Every aspect of its exterior decoration is imbued with symbolism. The hall is built in the shape of a tall mountain to represent Mount Meru, the mythological centre of the universe.\n\n\nThe spire is divided into three sections. The base is formed of seven superimposed layers, each representing a level of heaven in accordance with the Traiphum Buddhist cosmology. The middle section is in the shape of a bell, flattened to create a four-sided shape. This represents the \n in which the \n's ashes are interred. The top section is similar to the top of \n, depicting a tapered lotus bud or crystal dew drop which signifies the escape from the \n or cycle of rebirths. The spire is supported by \n on each of its four sides; as well as being a symbol of kingship, the garuda represents the mythical creatures of the \n forest surrounding Mount Meru.\n\n\nThe pediments are decorated with the figure of Narayana, a Hindu deity, riding a garuda. This associates the king with Narayana and further signifies his authority. According to legend, Narayana descended from heaven in human form to alleviate the suffering of mankind. He represents all the qualities of an ideal king. The throne hall stands on a high base with convex and concave mouldings. The bottom layer, according to Thai beliefs, resembles a lion's paw; the lion is a symbol of the Buddha's family and alludes to the Buddha's own royal heritage.\n\n\nThe most unusual feature of this throne hall is the small porch projecting from the front of the building. Under this porch stands the \n Throne (พระที่นั่งบุษบกมาลา), whose spire echoes that of the hall itself. The high base of this throne is surrounded by figures of praying deities. During the reign of King Rama I, it was used when the king appeared before the representatives of his vassal states; later, it was used for certain ceremonies. The two doors to the hall are situated on each side of the throne.\n\n\nThe interior walls of this throne hall are painted with a lotus bud design arranged in a geometric pattern. Praying deities sit within the buds, a common Thai motif often associated with holy places. The ceiling, which has a coffered octagonal section directly below the spire, is decorated with glass mosaic stars. This reinforces the impression of being in a heavenly abode. The interior panels of the door and window shutters depict standing deities facing each other, holding weapons as guards for the king. The thickness of the walls allows for the spaces between them and the shutters to be painted with murals depicting trees in Chinese style.\n\n\nThe wings of the hall hold thrones for use in various royal functions; these include the Mother-of-Pearl Throne (พระแท่นราชบัลลังก์ประดับมุก) which stands almost at the centre of the hall, at the intersection of the four wings. This square throne, topped with a Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella,\n is entirely \n with \n and dates from the reign of King Rama I. It was saved from the Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat when it burnt down in 1789.\n\n\nIn the eastern \n is the Mother-of-Pearl Bed (พระแท่นบรรทมประดับมุก) which was made to match the Mother-of-Pearl Throne. It was once the king's personal bed and was kept inside the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya; once it was no longer used, it was transferred to its current location. The bed takes the form of a high platform with many layers and small steps leading to the top. When royal ceremonies are carried out within the hall, members of the royal family take their seats in the southern transept, while government officials sit to the north, Buddhist monks to the east; the funeral urn is to the west. At such times the throne and bed are used as altars for images of the Buddha.\n\n\nBehind the Mother-of-Pearl Throne is the \n Throne (พระบัญชรบุษบกมาลา; \n). This half throne protrudes from the southern wall of the throne hall and opens into it like a window. Its style is similar to the Busabok Mala Throne on the porch outside. It was made during the reign of King Rama IV, in order for the palace women to attend important ceremonies through the window but stay behind a screen, separating them from men arriving from the outside.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งพิมานรัตยา) is located directly behind the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall. It is a residential palace, built for King Rama I as his main royal apartment. Over time its use as such declined and eventually ended; now it is only used as a ceremonial venue. It was built in the traditional rectangular Thai style. The east, west and south sides of the hall are surrounded on the outside by a \n, and the building itself is surrounded by two gardens. During the reign of King Rama VI it was used as a meeting and function hall for members of the royal family. It also provided a venue for the investiture ceremonies whereby individuals are awarded with \n by a member of the royal family. Currently the hall is only used, in conjunction with the Dusit Maha Prasat, as the main venue for state funerals.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งอาภรณ์ภิโมกข์ปราสาท; \n) is an open pavilion, built on a platform at the east wall of the Maha Prasat group by King Rama IV; it was used both as a robing place for the king to change his regalia when entering the Maha Prasat, and also as the royal palanquin mounting platform. The pavilion is considered the epitome of the finest qualities of Thai traditional architecture in proportion, style and detail. A smaller replica was exhibited at the \n.\n\n\nThe pavilion has a \n layout with the northern and southern ends being longer. The roof is topped with a spire of five tiers, making it a prasat rather than a 'maha prasat' (which has seven). The spire is supported by swans as opposed to the traditional garudas. The eastern pediment depicts the Hindu god \n standing on a \n with one foot raised, holding a sword in his left hand and his right hand raised in blessing.\n The columns of the pavilion are decorated with gold and silver glass mosaic in a floral pattern; the \n of these columns take the form of long lotus petals.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งราชกรัณยสภา; \n) is located at the southern end of the eastern wall. A closed rectangular building, it was designed as a council chamber for use by the king and his ministers. In 1897, on his first trip to Europe, King Rama V installed Queen \n as \n, and she presided over \n meetings here. In 1956 Queen \n again presided over the privy council as regent while King Rama IX briefly entered the \n as a monk. The building is still used occasionally by the king for private audiences. Its projecting pediments over the roof line, common during the Ayutthaya period, are a notable feature.\n\n\nThe \n (ศาลาเปลื้องเครื่อง) is a closed pavilion situated on the western wall of the Maha Prasat group. It was built by King Rama VI as a robing room. The building is a two-storied Thai style rectangular hall with a walkway leading from the top floor to the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall.\n\n\nA miniature model of \n (เขาไกรลาสจำลอง; \n), the mythical abode of Shiva, was built during the reign of King Rama IV. It is crowned with a miniature palace on its summit, used as the setting for an important ceremony called the \n.\n This ancient \n would be performed for a prince or princess around the age of thirteen. Sometimes lasting seven days of festivities, the tonsure ceremony involved a purifying bath and the cutting of the traditional topknot hair of the royal child. The king himself cut the child's hair, which was later thrown into the Chao Phraya river as an offering.\n The foot of the mountain is populated with statues of mythical animals from the Himavanta Forest. It is situated behind the walkway between the Dusit Maha Prasat Throne Hall and Ho Plueng Krueng. This area is considered part of the Inner Court and is not open to the public.\n\n\nThe Siwalai Garden (สวนศิวาลัย, \n) is situated to the easternmost part of the Middle court and is considered separate from the other state buildings and throne halls. The garden has been in its present form, since King Rama V, and contains both royal residences and religious buildings. Throughout the years several structures were built and demolished by various kings.  The garden was first created at the behest of King Rama I as a private retreat called the \n (สวนแก้ว) or 'Crystal Garden'. The name was changed by Rama II to \n or 'Right Garden', who also embellished the garden and transformed it into a \n for the inhabitants of the Inner Court.\n\n\nThe greatest change to the area occurred during the reign of King Rama IV, when the entire garden was turned into a new residential palace. This palace was composed of several interconnected buildings of various styles and sizes for the king's use. This buildings complex was named the \n (พระอภิเนาว์นิเวศน์; \n). The building group are on an east to west axis, with reception halls to the east and residential halls in the west. These buildings were built in a combination of Thai and Western styles; the principal building of the Phra Abhinaowas Niwet group was the \n; this European style grand audience chamber was used by the king to receive various foreign missions. Other buildings included King Rama IV's primary residential hall, observatory and banqueting hall. By the reign of King Rama V the Phra Abhinaowas Niwet building group became so dilapidated that most were eventually demolished; the names of some of the halls were later assumed by new royal buildings (for example the new \n in the \n). King Rama V had the area turned once more into a private garden for use by the Inner Court and also gave the garden its present name. The new garden contained some of the old buildings as well as new additions, such as a small lawn in the south western corner called the \n or 'Turtle Garden'.\n The layout of the Siwalai Garden remained mostly unchanged until the present day.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งบรมพิมาน; \n) is the largest structure within the Siwalai Garden; it is located at the northernmost end.\n The two-storey \n residence was constructed during the reign of King Rama V from 1897 to 1903. The new palace was built over the site of an old armoury, after King Rama V had it demolished. The new palace was intended as a gift to the first \n, Prince \n. It was originally named \n (พระที่นั่งภานุมาศจำรูญ). However, before the construction was finished the prince died of typhoid at the age of 16. Once completed the palace was handed to the next heir, Crown Prince Maha Vajiravudh, who ascended the throne in 1910 as Rama VI. He later gave the palace its present name.\n\n\nUnder the supervision of foreign architects, namely the German C. Sandreczki, the Boromphiman Throne Hall became the most modern building within the Grand Palace; it was also the first to be designed to accommodate carriages and motorcars.\n The exterior walls are embellished with \n and elaborate plaster designs. The triangular and semi-circular pediments are decorated with stuccoed floral motifs. The palace's distinctive \n is covered in dark grey slate tiles. On the façade of the building, the main and central pediment show the emblem of the crown prince.\n\n\nEven though the architectural style and exterior decoration of the building is entirely Western, the interior decorations is entirely Thai.\n The central hall, situated under a dome, is decorated with murals of the god \n, \n, \n and \n—all depicted in Thai style. Below them are Thai inscriptions composed by King Rama VI himself.\n\n\nAfter his accession to the throne, King Rama VI occasionally stayed at the palace. King Rama VII stayed at the palace for a few nights before his coronation in 1925, while King \n (Rama VIII) made the palace his main place of residence upon his return to Thailand from Switzerland in December 1945. He lived in this palace with his younger brother Prince Bhumibol Adulyadej (later King Rama IX) and his mother Princess \n. On the morning of 9 June 1946 the palace bore witness to his mysterious and unexplained death by gunshot.\n King Rama IX later refurbished the palace and added an extra wing extending south.\n\n\nCurrently the palace is not open to the public, and serves as the official guest house for visiting \n and their entourage.\n To the southeast of the Boromphiman Throne Hall, there are also two guest houses for use by the entourage of state visitors.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งมหิศรปราสาท) is a small pavilion built on the wall between the Siwalai Garden and the Maha Monthien buildings. The pavilion has a \n-style roof and a gilded spire, decorated in glass mosaic. The pavilion was built by King Rama IV as a monument to his father King Rama II. After its completion the ashes of King Rama II was moved and was housed in the pavilion. After the death of King Rama IV the ashes was moved back to the Ho Phra That Monthien Buddha Image Hall, currently the pavilion houses several Buddha images.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งศิวาลัยมหาปราสาท) is located on the southern-eastern end of the Siwalai Garden.\n The Siwalai Maha Prasat is a Thai-style edifice with a Mondop style spire of seven tiers. Built during the reign of King Rama V in 1878 to house the metal statues of his four predecessors, which were cast in 1869. The hall was to be used as a royal pantheon, where the lives of previous monarchs were to be commemorated and worshiped.\n Later King Rama VI had the statues removed and rehoused at the Prasat Phra Thep Bidorn in the Temple of the Emerald Buddha compound, where they would be more accessible to the public. On 6 April 1918 the first ceremony of worship was inaugurated, this ceremony continues to be performed annually. Since the removal of the statues, the Siwalai Maha Prasat has been left vacant.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งสีตลาภิรมย์) is a small open pavilion made of wood, built by King Rama VI. The pavilion is situated on the northern edge of the lawn south of the Boromphiman palace. The pavilion is decorated with a flame motif in \n. The gables bear the insignia of King Rama VI. The king used the pavilion as a place of rest and as a seat during garden parties.\n\n\nThe \n (พระพุทธรัตนสถาน) is a \n (or ordination hall), situated at the very centre of the Siwalai Garden. The religious building is a shrine to a Buddha image called the \n (พระพุทธบุษยรัตน์จักรพรรดิพิมลมณีมัย; \n) which was brought from \n in \n.\n The ubosot was built for this purpose by King Rama IV. The ubosot is built of grey stone and has a two-tier green title roof. At the front there is a portico of pillars. Running around the outside of the ubosot is an open pillared gallery. Religious ceremonies have been performed here in the past.\n\n\nThe Inner Court or the \n (เขตพระราชฐานชั้นใน), referred to simply as \n (ฝ่ายใน; \n; literally 'The Inside'), occupies the southernmost part of the Grand Palace complex. This area is reserved exclusively for use by the king and his \n of queens and consorts (minor wives). These women were often called 'forbidden women' or \n (นางห้าม; \n) by the general populace. Other inhabitants of the court were the king's children and a multitude of ladies-in-waiting and servants. The king's royal consorts were drawn from the ranks of the Siamese: royalty and nobility. Usually there were also the daughters of rulers of tributary states.\n Royal \n ended in practice during the reign of King Rama VI, who refused to keep a polygamous household. It was ended officially by King Rama VII in the early 20th century, when he outlawed the practice for all and took only one consort: Queen \n. By this time the inhabitants of the court had dwindled to only a few and finally disappeared within a few decades afterwards.\n Historically the Inner Court was a town complete within itself, divided by narrow streets and lawns. It had its own shops, government, schools, warehouses, laws and law courts, all exclusively controlled by women for the royal women. Men on special repair work and doctors were admitted only under the watchful eyes of its female guards. The king's sons were permitted to live inside until they reached puberty; after their tonsure ceremonies they were sent outside the palace for further education.\n There are currently no inhabitants within the Inner Court and the buildings within are not used for any purpose; nevertheless, the entire court is closed to the public.\n\n\nThe population of the Inner Court varied over different periods, but by all accounts it was large.\n Each queen consort had her own household of around 200 to 300 women. Her various ladies-in-waiting were usually recruited from noble families; others were minor princesses who would also have a retinue of servants. Each minor wife or consort (เจ้าจอม; \n) had a fairly large household; this would increase significantly if she gave birth to the king's child, as she would be elevated to the rank of consort mother (เจ้าจอมมารดา; \n). Each royal lady had a separate establishment, the size of which was in proportion to her rank and status in accordance with palace law. Altogether the population of the Inner Court numbered nearly 3,000 inhabitants.\n\n\nThe Inner Court was once populated by small low-lying structures surrounded by gardens, lawns and ponds. Over the course of the late 19th century new residential houses were constructed in this space, resulting in overcrowded conditions. Most of the buildings that remain were constructed during the reign of King Rama V in Western styles, mostly \n.\n The residences vary in size and are divided into three categories; small royal villas or \n (พระตำหนัก; \n), villas or \n (ตำหนัก; \n) and houses or \n (เรือน; \n). Each was distributed to the inhabitants in accordance with their rank and stature. The court is surrounded and separated from the rest of the Grand Palace by a second set of walls within, parallel to those that ring around the palace as a whole. These walls are punctuated by a set of gates that connects the Middle the Inner Courts to the outside and to each other; the entrance through these gates were strictly monitored.\n The three main building groups in the Middle Court are built so that the residential halls of each are situated to the south and straddled the boundary between the Middle and Inner Court. Thus these residential spaces of the king became the focal point of palace life and the lives of the palace women on the inside.\n Immediately behind these residential halls are the large royal villas of high-ranking consorts such as Queen \n and Queen \n. Surrounding them are smaller villas belonging to other consorts such as those belonging to Princess Consort \n. Finally at the lower end (the southernmost part) are the row houses or \n (แถวเต๊ง; \n) for the middle- and low-ranking consorts.\n These residences also functioned as a de facto secondary layer of surveillance, at the very edges of the Inner Court.\n\n\nThe Inner Court was governed by a series of laws known as the \n (กฎมนเทียรบาล, \n; literally 'Palace Maintenance Law'). Some of the laws dated back to the times of the Kingdom of Ayutthaya. Most of them deal with the hierarchy and status of the women, while others deal with their behaviour and conduct.\n The order and discipline of the inhabitants were enforced by a regiment of all-female guards (กรมโขลน, \n; \n). These guards were described by Prince \n as \"tough looking amazons\".\n The head of this body was known as the \n (อธิบดีฝ่ายใน; \n) the directress of the inside, under her command were various officials. These officials had specific responsibilities concerning every facet of life within the Inner Court. These responsibilities included duties concerning: discipline and jails, the maintenance of Buddhist images, the guarding of gates, the inner treasury and expenditure. One of their main duties was to accompany men, once they were admitted into the area, and to remain with them until they left. They controlled the traffic of the court and were drilled like regular soldiers. When any person of importance passed along the streets they ran ahead and cleared the way for them. At night they patrolled the streets with lamps or torches.\n Misbehaviour or indiscretion on behalf of the wives was punishable by death, for the women and the man.\n The last such punishment was met out in 1859 to a young nobleman and a minor wife, who were having an affair.\n\n\nOnly the children of the king could be born inside the Inner Court. Every detail of the birth of the royal child was recorded, including the time of birth, which was to be used later by \n to cast his or her \n. Ceremonies concerning the birth and the rites of passage of the child were performed within the walls of the Inner Court. The birth of a royal child was first announced by a succession of women who proclaimed the news along the Inner Court's streets. There were two waiting orchestras, one on the inside made of women and one on the outside of men, who would then carry out the official proclamation with conch shell fanfares. If the child was a prince the Gong of Victory was to be struck three times. The children would live with their respective mothers and be educated in special schools within the court.\n\n\nAlthough the women of 'The Inside' could never have the same level of freedom to those on the outside, life inside the Inner Court was not disagreeable, as life was easier than the outside and most necessities were provided for. The women usually entered the palace as girls and remained inside for the rest of their lives. As girls they would be assigned certain duties as pages; as they grew older and became wives and mothers they would have a household to look after. During the reign of King Rama IV, the women of the palace were for the first time allowed to leave; however they were required to obtain permission from the directoress first and were strictly chaperoned.\n \n, physician to Queen Saovabha Phongsri from 1914 to 1919, wrote that, \"there is no evidence to show that they longed for freedom or were unhappy in their surroundings. Even Mrs. Leonowens, fanatical opponent of polygamy that she was, does not tell us that\".\n Indeed, \n' book \n, published in 1873, was set inside the Inner Court.\n\nThe castellated \n of the Grand Palace were constructed during the reign of King Rama I in 1782. Later during the reign of King Rama II the Grand Palace and its walls were extended towards the south. Cannon emplacements were replaced with guard houses and were given rhyming names. The northern wall measures 410 metres, the east 510 metres, the south 360 metres and the west 630 metres, a total of 1,910 metres (6,270 ft). There are 12 gates in the outer walls. Inside the palace, there were over 22 gates and a labyrinth of inner walls; however some of these have already been demolished. Around the outer walls there are also 17 small forts. On the eastern wall, facing Sanamchai Road, there are two throne halls.\n\n\nThe \n (พระที่นั่งไชยชุมพล; \n) is located on the north of the eastern wall, opposite the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. The small rectangular pavilion was built on the top of the wall of the palace. The pavilion has a roof of two tiers and is covered with grey tiles.\n The exterior is decorated with black lacquer and glass mosaic. The pavilion was built by King Rama IV as a \n, where he could observe royal and religious processions going by along the Sanamchai Road. The pavilion was also used for a time as the main shrine of the Phra Siam Thevathiraj figure, before it was moved to its current shrine in the Phaisan Thaksin Hall.\n\n\nSituated on the south eastern wall of the Grand Palace is the \n (พระที่นั่งสุทไธสวรรยปราสาท); the hall sits between the Deva Phitak and Sakdi Chaisit Gates on the eastern wall.\n It was first built by King Rama I in imitation of the \"Phra Thinang Chakrawat Phaichayont\" (พระที่นั่งจักรวรรดิ์ไพชยนต์; \n) on the walls of the Royal Palace in Ayutthaya. Originally called the \n or high pavilion, it was made entirely of wood and was an open-air structure. During the reign of King Rama III, a new structure was built out of brick and mortar. This new structure was renamed \n (พระที่นั่งสุทไธสวรรย์; \n). The hall is used by the king to give audiences to the public and view military parades.\n\n\nThe new structure consists of two-stories, the lower in Western style and the top level in Thai design. The central pavilion has a wooden balcony, which is used by the king and royal family for the granting of public audiences. The roof over the central pavilion is topped by a five-tier prasat in Mondop style, decorated in glass mosaic. The hall's wings stretching from the north to the south, each has nine large windows along the exterior. Later in the reign of King Rama V, the entire structure was refurbished and finally given its present name.\n\n\nThe Grand Palace has twelve \n (ประตู, \n, literally a door), three along each of the four walls. These massive gates are built of brick and mortar and are topped with a \n style spire. These gates are all painted in white, with gigantic red doors. Each of these outer gates were given rhyming names, starting from the north west in a clockwise direction around.\n\n\nAlong the walls of the Grand Palace there are seventeen \n (ป้อม, \n); originally there were only ten, with later additions made. These small structures are usually small \n with \n placements and \n. The forts were also given rhyming names.\n\n\nThe Museum of the Emerald Buddha Temple (พิพิธภัณฑ์วัดพระศรีรัตนศาสดาราม), despite its name, is the main artefacts repository of both the Grand Palace and Temple of the Emerald Buddha complex. The museum is located between the Outer and Middle Court and sits opposite the Phra Thinang Maha Prasat Group. A building was constructed on the present location in 1857 during the reign of King Rama IV as the \n (โรงกษาปณ์สิทธิการ, \n; \n). King Rama V ordered the mint to be enlarged, but not long after this the building was destroyed by fire and needed to be rebuilt.\n\n\nThe two-story structure is rectangular in shape. The \n has four \n with fluted stems and cabbage leaf capitals. The front gables of the building have Renaissance style plaster moulding. The lower part of the exterior walls are made of plastered brick. The upper windows have semi-circular French windows, with pilasters on both sides.\n In 1902 a new royal mint department was constructed outside the palace's walls and the old mint building was left vacant. The building was then first converted for use as a royal guards barracks and later as a royal guards officer's club.\n\n\nIn 1982, on the bicentennial anniversary year of the founding of Bangkok and the building of the Grand Palace, the building was selected as the site of a new museum. It was established at the instigation of Princess \n to hold certain architectural elements, which had to be replaced; various artefacts and Buddha images that were donated to the Grand Palace by the general public.\n\n\nThe ground floor of the museum displays a varied selection of artefacts.\n These included certain architectural elements, which were removed from various buildings within the Grand Palace during different renovations, as well as were the stone Buddha images and Chinese statues. They included many figures from \n, the \n, such as \n and \n. The stone figures date from the reign of King Rama III, and were later moved to the museum to prevent damage.\n In the central hall are the bones of \n. These elephants were not actually white but have certain special characteristics such as pinkish colouring and cream eyes. The White elephant was an important symbol of kingship; the more the monarch possessed the greater was his prestige. This belief and veneration of the animal is common to many other South-east Asian cultures.\n \n\nThe upper floor rooms display more artistic and precious objects. In the main hall are two \n of the Grand Palace, the first representing the Grand Palace during the reign of King Rama I, and another in the reign of King Rama V. Behind these are numerous Buddha images and commemorative coins. In the doorway leading to the main hall is a small mother-of-pearl seating platform known as \n (พระแท่นทรงสบาย), which was once located in the Phra Thinang Phiman Rattaya Throne Hall. The platform was used for informal audiences and dates from the time of King Rama I.\n At the end of the main hall stands the \n Throne (พระแท่นมนังคศิลาอาสน์; \n), which is believed to date to the \n and was brought back to Bangkok, from Sukhothai, by King Rama IV, when he was still a monk. Against the walls on either side of the hall are four different Buddha images of \n; they were purchased by King Rama V. The room to the right of the Manangsila Throne displays the various seasonal robes of the Emerald Buddha. To the left of the main hall is a lacquer ware \n depicting the crowning of \n, king of the gods. The screen was formerly kept in the Phra Thinang Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat; it was saved from the fire apparently by the hands of King Rama I himself. The rest of the upper floor displays various \n (such as a model of Mount Kailasa) and more Buddha images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},

The \n (\n: \n, historically, \n; \n: \n) is the \n and head of the ruling Royal \n.\n\nAlthough the current Chakri dynasty was created in 1782, the existence of the institution of monarchy in Thailand is traditionally considered to have its roots in the founding of the \n in 1238, with a brief \n from the death of \n to the accession of \n in the 18th century. The institution was transformed into a \n in 1932 after the bloodless \n. The monarchy's official ceremonial residence is the \n in \n, while the private residence has been at the \n. \nThe king of Thailand is \n, \n of the \n, adherent of \n and upholder of \n.\n\n\nThe current concept of Thai kingship evolved through 800 years of absolute rule. The first king of a unified \n was the founder of the \n, King \n, in 1238.\n The idea of this early kingship is said to be based on two concepts derived from \n and \n beliefs. The first concept is based on the ancient Indian \n (\n: \n, or warrior-ruler, in which the king derives his powers from military might. The second is based on the Buddhist concept of \n (\n: \n, Buddhism having been introduced to Thailand around the 6th century CE. The idea of the Dhammaraja (or kingship under Dharma) is that the king should rule his people in accordance with \n and the teachings of the Buddha.\n\nThese ideas were briefly replaced in 1279, when King \n came to the throne. Ramkhamhaeng departed from tradition and created instead a concept of \"\n\" (\n: \n, in which the king governs his people as a father would govern his children.\n This idea is reinforced in the title and name of the king, as he is still known today, \n (\n: \n meaning 'Father Ruler Ramkhamhaeng'. This lasted briefly. By the end of the kingdom, the two old concepts returned as symbolized by the change in the style of the kings: \"Pho\" was changed to \"Phaya\" or Lord.\n\nThe Kingdom of Sukhothai was supplanted by the \n, which was founded in 1351 by King \n. During the Ayutthayan period, the idea of kingship changed. Due to ancient Khmer tradition in the region, the Hindu concept of kingship was applied to the status of the leader. Brahmins took charge in the \n. The king was treated as a \n of \n. Ayutthaya historical documents show the official titles of the kings in great variation: \n, \n and \n, or \n. Seemingly, Rama was the most popular, as in \"Ramathibodhi\". However, Buddhist influence was also evident, as many times the king's title and \"unofficial\" name \"Dhammaraja\", an abbreviation of the \n. The two former concepts were re-established, with a third, older concept taking hold. This concept was called \"\n\" (\n: \n (or \"divine king\"), which was an idea borrowed by the \n from the \n, especially the idea of a scholar class based on Hindu \n. The concept centered on the idea that the king was an incarnation (\n) of the god \n and that he was a \n (enlightened one), therefore basing his power on his religious power, his moral power, and his purity of blood.\n\nThe king, portrayed by state interests as a semi-divine figure, then became—through a rigid cultural implementation—an object of worship and veneration to his people. From then on the monarchy was largely removed from the people and continued under a system of absolute rule. Living in palaces designed after \n (\"home of the gods\" in Hinduism), the kings turned themselves into a \"\n\", where the king became an absolute and universal lord of his realm. Kings demanded that the universe be envisioned as \n, and expressed their powers through elaborate rituals and ceremonies. For four centuries these kings ruled Ayutthaya, presiding over some of the greatest period of cultural, economic, and military growth in \n.\n\nThe Kings of Ayutthaya created many institutions to support their rule. Whereas \n developed in the \n, Ayutthayan King \n in the 15th century instituted \n, a system of social hierarchy which ranked the king's subjects according to the amount of land they were entitled to, according to their rank and position.\n\n\n is required by court etiquette as an \n consisting of a special vocabulary used exclusively for addressing the king, or for talking about royalty.\n\nThe king was chief administrator, chief legislator, and chief judge, with all laws, orders, verdict and punishments theoretically originating from his person. The king's \n was reflected in the titles \"Lord of the Land\" (\n \n) and \"Lord of Life\" (\n \n). The king's powers and titles were seen by foreign observers as proof that the king was an \n in the European sense. However, in Siamese tradition the duty and responsibility of the king was seen as developed from the \n, which resemble \n, although the emphasis is not on \n but on \n.\n This was disrupted in 1767, when Thai digests of the \n (\n) were lost when a \n army under the \n invaded, sacked and burned the city of \n.\n\nAn interlude filled by a short \n was ended when \n restored the country under what has been called the \n. Kingship during the Thonburi period saw the adoption of the 'personal kingship' system that was previously administered under \n (but abandoned after his death). Taksin treated the concept of kingship by abandoning the shroud of mysticism usually adopted by many Ayutthayan monarchs; he often revealed himself to the common folk by partaking in public activities and traditional festivities. He did little to emphasize his new capital, \n, as the spiritual successor to Ayutthaya. He also emphasized the building of moats and defensive walls in Thonburi.\n\n\nIn 1782, \n ascended the throne and moved the capital from the \n side to the \n side of the \n. There he established the \n, the current ruling dynasty of Thailand. (This first reign was later designated as that of Rama I in the list of \n.) He also established the office of \n as the head of the \n, the order of \n \n.\n\nDuring the \n the Chakri kings tried to continue the concepts of Ayutthayan kingship once again emphasizing the connection between the sovereign and his subjects. On the other hand, they continued to not relinquish any authority of the throne. Kings \n (Rama II) and \n (Rama III) created a semblance of a modern administration by creating a supreme council and appointing chief officers to help with the running of the government.\n\n\n (Rama IV) marked a significant break in tradition when he spent the first 27 years of his adult life as a \n during which time he became proficient in the English language, before ascending the throne. As king, he continued the appointment of officers to his supreme council, the most notable being \n \n and \n, both of whom acted as Chief Ministers for King Mongkut (and the latter as \n, from the king's death in 1868 until 1873.)\n\n (Rama V) ascended the throne as a minor at age 15 in 1868, and as King of Siam on 16 November 1873. As a prince, he had been tutored in Western traditions by the \n, \n.\n Intent on reforming the monarchy along Western lines, during his minority he traveled extensively to observe western administrative methods. He transformed the monarchy along Western lines of an \"\n\". He abolished the practice of \n in front of the monarch, and repealed many laws concerning the relationship between the monarch and his people, while continuing many of the ancient aspects and rituals of the old kingship.\n In 1874, he created a \n copied from the European tradition, to help him rule his Kingdom. During his reign Siam was pressured to relinquish control of its old tributaries of Laos and northern Malaya to Western powers, Siam itself narrowly avoided being colonized.\n In 1905, 37 years after his coronation, Chulalongkorn ended \n with the Slave Abolition Act. In 1867 slaves accounted for one-third of the Siamese population.\n\nHis son, \n (Rama VI), ascended to the throne in 1910 and continued his father's zeal for reform to bring the monarchy into the 20th century. The perceived slow pace of reform resulted in the \n. In 1914, Vajiravudh determined that the act providing for invoking \n, first promulgated by his father in 1907, was not consistent with modern \n, nor convenient for the preservation of the security of the state, so it was amended to a more modern form that, with minor amendments, continued in force through subsequent changes in government.\n\n\n (Rama VII) succeeded his brother in 1925. The \n and \n educated monarch created a council similar to a \n, where the most important government officials could meet to decide state affairs. This advisory and legislative council, styled the \n (Thai: อภิรัฐมนตรีสภา) was founded on 28 November 1925 and existed until 1932.\n\nIn June 1932, a group of foreign-educated students and military men called \"\n\" carried out a bloodless \n, seized power and demanded that King Prajadhipok grant the people of Siam a constitution. The king agreed and in December 1932 the people were granted \n, ending 150 years of absolute Chakri rule. From then on the role of the monarch was relegated to that of a symbolic head of state. His powers from then on were exercised by a \n and the \n.\n\nIn 1935 Prajadhipok (Rama VII) abdicated the throne, following disagreements with the government. He lived in exile in the United Kingdom until his death in 1941. The king was replaced by his young nephew \n (Rama VIII). The new king was 10 years old and was living abroad in \n. A council of regents was appointed in his place. During this period the roles and powers of the king were entirely usurped by the \n government of \n, who changed the name of the kingdom from Siam to \n, and aligned it on the side of the \n in the \n. By the end of the war Phibunsongkhram was removed and the young king returned. The \n movement provided resistance to foreign occupation during the war and helped rehabilitate Thailand after the war.\n\nAfter Rama VIII's sudden death from a bullet wound in 1946, Prince \n (Rama IX), aged 19 years old, became the new monarch. In establishing his rule, the king was aided by the efforts of the US government, who used the monarchy as a bulwark against communist gains in Southeast Asia.\n\n\nKing Bhumibol was the world's longest reigning monarch at the time of his death in October 2016. He died on 13 October 2016 at the age of 88.\n\n\nSince 2000, the role of the Thai monarchy has been increasingly challenged by scholars, students, media, observers and traditionalists, and as pro-democracy interests began to express their speech.\n Many deemed that a series of laws and measures relating to \n are hindrances to freedom of expression.

{"title": "Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n\n\nThe \n of 1914–1917 is considered to be the last major expedition of the \n. Conceived by \n, the expedition was an attempt to make the first land crossing of the Antarctic continent. After \n's \n in 1911, this crossing remained, in Shackleton's words, the \"one great main object of Antarctic journeyings\".\n Shackleton's expedition failed to accomplish this objective but became recognized instead as an epic feat of endurance.\n\nShackleton had served in the Antarctic on the \n of 1901–1904 and had led the \n of 1907–1909. In this new venture, he proposed to sail to the \n and to land a shore party near \n, in preparation for a transcontinental march via the \n to the \n. A supporting group, the \n, would meanwhile establish camp in \n and from there lay a series of supply depots across the \n to the foot of the \n. These depots would be essential for the transcontinental party's survival, as the group would not be able to carry enough provisions for the entire crossing. The expedition required two ships: \n under Shackleton for the Weddell Sea party, and \n, under \n, for the Ross Sea party.\n\n became beset—trapped in the ice of the Weddell Sea—before it was able to reach Vahsel Bay. It drifted northward, held in the pack ice, throughout the Antarctic winter of 1915. Eventually the ice crushed the ship, and it sank, stranding its complement of 28 men on the ice. After months spent in makeshift camps as the ice continued its northwards drift, the party used lifeboats that had been salvaged from the ship to reach the inhospitable, uninhabited \n. Shackleton and five other members of the group then made an 800-mile (1,300 km) open-boat journey in the \n, and were able to reach \n. From there, Shackleton was eventually able to arrange a rescue of the men who had remained on Elephant Island and to bring them home without loss of life. The remarkably preserved \n was found on the seafloor in 2022.\n\n\nOn the other side of the continent, the Ross Sea party overcame great hardships to fulfill its mission. \n was blown from her moorings during a gale and was unable to return, leaving the shore party stranded without proper supplies or equipment. Although the depots were still able to be laid, three people died before the party was eventually rescued.\n\nDespite the public acclaim that had greeted \n's achievements after the \n in 1907–1909, the explorer was unsettled, becoming—in the words of British skiing pioneer Sir \n—\"a bit of a floating gent\".\n By 1912, his future Antarctic plans depended on the results of \n's \n, which had left \n in July 1910, and on the concurrent \n led by \n. The news of Amundsen's conquest of the \n reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\".\n The next work, he said, would be \"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\".\n He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective.\n\nOn 11 December 1911, a German expedition under \n had sailed from \n, intending to penetrate deep into the \n and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the \n.\n In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base.\n However, his reports of possible landing sites in \n, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.\n\n\nNews of the deaths of Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey.\n He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, \n of Scott's expedition, and the former \n \n, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\".\n\n\nShackleton got support, however, from \n, leader of the \n of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908 but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to adopt his plans,\n although the eventual scheme announced by Shackleton owed little to Bruce. On 29 December 1913, having acquired his first promises of financial backing—a £10,000 grant from the British government—Shackleton made his plans public in a letter to \n.\n\n\nShackleton called his new expedition the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, because he felt that \"not only the people of these islands, but our kinsmen in all the lands under the \n will be willing to assist towards the carrying out of the ... programme of exploration.\"\n To arouse the interest of the general public, he issued a detailed programme early in 1914. The expedition was to consist of two parties and two ships. The Weddell Sea party would travel aboard \n and continue to the Vahsel Bay area, where 14 men would land, of whom six, under Shackleton, would form the transcontinental party. This group, with 69 dogs, two motor sledges, and equipment \"embodying everything that the experience of the leader and his expert advisers can suggest\",\n would undertake the 1,800-mile (2,900 km) journey to the Ross Sea. The remaining eight shore party members would carry out scientific work, three going to \n, three to \n and two remaining at base camp.\n\n\nThe \n would set up its base in \n, on the opposite side of the continent. After landing they would lay depots on the route of the transcontinental party as far as the \n, hopefully meeting that party there and assisting it home. They would also make geological and other observations.\n\n\nShackleton estimated that he would need £50,000 (current value £5,105,000) to carry out the simplest version of his plan.\n He did not believe in appeals to the public: \"(they) cause endless book-keeping worries\".\n His chosen method of fundraising was to solicit contributions from wealthy backers, and he had begun this process early in 1913 with little initial success.\n The first significant encouragement came in December 1913, when the British government offered him £10,000, provided he could raise an equivalent amount from private sources.\n The \n (RGS), from which he had expected nothing, gave him £1,000—according to Huntford, Shackleton, in a grand gesture, advised them that he would only need to take up half of this sum.\n Lord Rosebery, who had previously expressed his lack of interest in polar expeditions, gave £50.\n\n\nIn February 1914, \n reported that playwright \n—a close friend of Scott, who had become Shackleton's rival late in his career—had confidentially donated $50,000 (about £10,000). With time running out, contributions were eventually secured during the first half of 1914. \n of the \n gave £10,000, wealthy tobacco heiress \n gave a \"generous\" sum (the amount was not revealed),\n and, in June, Scottish industrialist Sir \n donated £24,000 (current value £2,450,000). Shackleton informed the \n that \"this magnificent gift relieves me of all anxiety\".\n\n\nShackleton now had the money to proceed. He acquired, for £14,000 (current value £1,430,000),\n a 300-ton \n called \n, which had been built for the Belgian explorer \n for an expedition to \n. This scheme had collapsed and the ship became available.\n Shackleton changed her name to \n, reflecting his family motto, \"By endurance we conquer\".\n For a further £3,200 (current value £327,000), he acquired \n's expedition ship \n, which was lying in \n, \n. This would act as the Ross Sea party's vessel.\n\n\nHow much money Shackleton raised to meet the total costs of the expedition (later estimated by the \n to be around £80,000)\n is uncertain, since the size of the Stancomb-Wills donation is not known. Money was a constant problem for Shackleton, who as an economy measure halved the funding allocated to the Ross Sea party, a fact which the party's commander \n only discovered when he arrived in Australia to take up his duties.\n Mackintosh was forced to haggle and plead for money and supplies to make his part of the expedition viable.\n Shackleton had, however, realised the revenue-earning potential of the expedition. He sold the exclusive newspaper rights to the \n, and formed the Imperial Trans Antarctic Film Syndicate to take advantage of the film rights.\n\n\nAccording to legend, Shackleton posted an advertisement in a London paper, stating: \"\n.\" Searches for the original advertisement have proved unsuccessful, and the story is generally regarded as apocryphal.\n Shackleton received more than 5,000 applications for places on the expedition, including a letter from \"three sporty girls\" who suggested that if their feminine garb was inconvenient they would \"just love to don masculine attire.\"\n\n\nEventually the crews for the two arms of the expedition were trimmed down to 28 apiece, including \n, who joined the ship in Buenos Aires; his friend \n, who stowed away when his application was turned down;\n and several last-minute appointments made to the Ross Sea party in Australia.\n A temporary crewman was Sir Daniel Gooch, grandson of the renowned railway pioneer \n, who stepped in to help Shackleton as a dog handler at the last moment and signed up for an able seaman's pay.\n Gooch agreed to sail with \n as far as South Georgia.\n\n\nAs his second-in-command, Shackleton chose \n, who had been with him on both the \n and \n expeditions, and was one of the \n party in 1909.\n Wild had just returned from Mawson's \n. To captain \n Shackleton had wanted \n, who had commanded \n during the Australasian Antarctic Expedition. Davis refused, thinking the enterprise was \"foredoomed\",\n so the appointment went to \n, who claimed to have applied to the expedition after learning of it in a dream.\n \n, who had been awarded the \n for saving the life of Lieutenant \n on the \n Expedition, took leave from the \n to sign on as \ns second officer; another experienced Antarctic hand, \n, became third officer.\n Two \n veterans were assigned to the Ross Sea party: Mackintosh, who commanded it, and \n. Shackleton had hoped that \n would be staffed by a naval crew, and had asked the \n for officers and men, but was turned down.\n After pressing his case, Shackleton was given one officer from the \n, Captain \n, who was Superintendent of Physical Training at the Marines training depot.\n\n\nThe scientific staff of six accompanying \n comprised the two surgeons, \n and \n; a geologist, \n; a biologist, \n; a physicist, \n; and \n, a meteorologist who would eventually edit Shackleton's expedition account \n. The visual record of the expedition was the responsibility of its photographer \n and its artist \n.\n The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. Some who left Britain for Australia to join \n resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and a full complement of crew was in doubt until the last minute.\n Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the \n expedition and had gone home early.\n\n\n, without Shackleton (who was detained in England by expedition business), left \n on 8 August 1914, heading first for \n. Here Shackleton, who had travelled on a faster ship, rejoined the expedition. Hurley also came on board, together with Bakewell and the stowaway, Blackborow, while several others left the ship or were discharged.\n On 26 October, the ship sailed for the South Atlantic, arriving in South Georgia on 5 November. Shackleton's original intention was that the crossing would take place in the first season, 1914–1915.\n Although he soon recognised the impracticality of this, he neglected to inform Mackintosh and the Ross Sea party of his change of plan. According to the \ns correspondent Ernest Perris, a cable intended for Mackintosh was never sent.\n\n\nAfter a month-long halt in the \n whaling station on \n, \n departed for the Antarctic on 5 December.\n Two days later, Shackleton was disconcerted to encounter \n as far north as 57° 26′S,\n forcing the ship to manoeuvre. During the following days there were more tussles with the pack, which, on 14 December, was thick enough to halt the ship for 24 hours. Three days later, the ship was stopped again. Shackleton commented: \"I had been prepared for evil conditions in the Weddell Sea, but had hoped that the pack would be loose. What we were encountering was fairly dense pack of a very obstinate character\".\n\n\ns progress was frustratingly slow, until, on 22 December, leads opened up and the ship was able to continue steadily southward. This continued for the next two weeks, taking the party deep into the Weddell Sea.\n Further delays then slowed progress after the turn of the year, before a lengthy run south during 7–10 January 1915 brought them close to the 100-foot (30 m) ice walls which guarded the Antarctic coastal region of \n. This territory had been discovered and named by William Speirs Bruce in 1904 during the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition.\n On 15 January, \n came abreast of a great \n, the edge of which formed a bay which appeared a good landing place. However, Shackleton considered it too far north of Vahsel Bay for a landing, \"except under pressure of necessity\"—a decision he would later regret.\n On 17 January, the ship reached a latitude of 76° 27′S, where land was faintly discernible. Shackleton named it \n, after his principal backer. Bad weather forced the ship to shelter in the lee of a stranded \n.\n\n\n was now close to \n, discovered by Filchner in 1912, at the southern end of which lay their destination, Vahsel Bay. Next day, the ship was forced north-westward for 14 miles (23 km), resuming in a generally southerly direction before being stopped altogether.\n The position was 76° 34′S, 31° 30′W. After ten days of inactivity, \ns fires were banked to save fuel.\n Strenuous efforts were made to release her; on 14 February, Shackleton ordered men onto the ice with ice-chisels, prickers, saws and picks to try to force a passage, but the labour proved futile. Shackleton did not at this stage abandon all hope of breaking free, but was now contemplating the \"possibility of having to spend a winter in the inhospitable arms of the pack\".\n\n\nOn 22 February 1915, \n, still held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76° 58′S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction.\n On 24 February, Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter and ordered ship's routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or \"dogloos\", and the ship's interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A \n apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.\n\n\nShackleton was aware of the recent example of Filchner's ship, \n, which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship was trapped on 6 March 1912, about 200 miles (320 km) off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63° 37', the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow \n to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.\n\n\nIn February and March, the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March, Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere 95 miles (153 km) since 19 January.\n However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April, Shackleton recorded the nearby pack \"piling and rafting against the masses of ice\"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance \"she would be crushed like an eggshell\".\n In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75° 23′S, 42° 14′W, still drifting northwards. It would be at least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice, and there was no certainty that \n would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area.\n Shackleton now considered the possibility of finding an alternative landing ground on the western shores of the Weddell Sea, if that coast could be reached. \"In the meantime\", he wrote, \"we must wait\".\n\n\nIn the dark winter months of May, June and July, Shackleton was concerned with maintaining fitness, training and morale. Although the scope for activity was limited, the dogs were exercised (and on occasion raced competitively), men were encouraged to take moonlight walks, and aboard ship there were attempted theatricals. Special occasions such as \n were duly celebrated.\n The first signs of the ice breaking up occurred on 22 July. On 1 August, in a south-westerly gale with heavy snow, the ice floe began to disintegrate all around the ship, the pressure forcing masses of ice beneath the \n and causing a heavy list to \n. The position was perilous; Shackleton wrote: \"The effects of the pressure around us was awe-inspiring. Mighty blocks of ice [...] rose slowly till they jumped like cherry-stones gripped between thumb and finger [...] if the ship was once gripped firmly her fate would be sealed\".\n This danger passed, and the succeeding weeks were quiet. During this relative lull the ship drifted into the area where, in 1823, Captain \n of the sealer \n reported seeing a coastline which he identified as \"\n\". There was no sign of any such land; Shackleton concluded that Morrell had been deceived by the presence of large icebergs.\n\n\nOn 30 September, the ship sustained what Shackleton described as \"the worst squeeze we had experienced\".\n Worsley described the pressure as like being \"thrown to and fro like a \n a dozen times\".\n On 24 October, the starboard side was forced against a large floe, increasing the pressure until the hull began to bend and splinter, so that water from below the ice began to pour into the ship. When the timbers broke they made noises which sailors later described as being similar to the sound of \"heavy fireworks and the blasting of guns\".\n The supplies and three lifeboats were transferred to the ice, while the crew attempted to shore up the ship's hull and pump out the incoming sea. However, after a few days, on 27 October 1915, and in freezing temperatures below −15 °F (−26 °C), Shackleton gave the order to abandon ship. The position at abandonment was 69° 05′S, 51° 30′W.\n The wreckage remained afloat, and over the following weeks the crew salvaged further supplies and materials, including Hurley's photographs and cameras that had initially been left behind. From around 550 plates, Hurley chose the best 120, the maximum that could be carried, and smashed the rest.\n\n\nWith the loss of \n the transcontinental plans were abandoned, and the focus shifted to that of survival. Shackleton's intention now was to march the crew westward, to one or other of several possible destinations. His first thought was for \n, where he knew there was a hut containing a substantial food depot, because he had ordered it 12 years earlier while organising relief for \n's stranded Swedish expedition.\n Other possibilities were \n, which had been Nordenskjöld's winter quarters and which was believed to contain a stock of emergency supplies,\n or \n.\n Shackleton believed that from one of these islands they would be able to reach and cross Graham Land and get to the whaling outposts in \n.\n He calculated that on the day \n was abandoned they were 346 miles (557 km) from Paulet Island.\n Worsley calculated the distance to Snow Hill Island to be 312 miles (500 km), with a further 120 miles (190 km) to Wilhelmina Bay.\n He believed the march was too risky; they should wait until the ice carried them to open water, and then escape in the boats. Shackleton over-ruled him.\n\n\nBefore the march could begin, Shackleton ordered the weakest animals to be shot, including the carpenter \n's cat, \n, and a pup which had become a pet of the surgeon Macklin.\n The company set out on 30 October 1915, with two of the ship's lifeboats carried on \n. Problems quickly arose as the condition of the sea ice around them worsened. According to Hurley the surface became \"a labyrinth of hummocks and ridges\" in which barely a square yard was smooth.\n In three days, the party managed to travel barely two miles (3.2 km), and on 1 November, Shackleton abandoned the march; they would make camp and await the break-up of the ice.\n They gave the name \"Ocean Camp\" to the flat and solid-looking floe on which their aborted march had ended, and settled down to wait. Parties continued to revisit the \n wreck, which was still drifting with the ice a short distance from the camp. More of the abandoned supplies were retrieved until, on 21 November, the ship finally slipped beneath the ice.\n The final resting place of \n would remain a mystery for nearly 107 years, until the wreckage was discovered on 5 March 2022.\n\n\nThe ice was not drifting fast enough to be noticeable, although by late November the speed was up to seven miles (11 km) a day.\n By 5 December, they had passed 68°S, but the direction was turning slightly east of north.\n This was taking the transcontinental party to a position from which it would be difficult to reach Snow Hill Island, although Paulet Island, further north, remained a possibility.\n Paulet Island was about 250 miles (400 km) away, and Shackleton was anxious to reduce the length of the lifeboat journey that would be necessary to reach it. Therefore, on 21 December he announced a second march, to begin on 23 December.\n\n\nConditions, however, had not improved since the earlier attempt. Temperatures had risen and it was uncomfortably warm, with men sinking to their knees in soft snow as they struggled to haul the boats through the pressure ridges. On 27 December, McNish rebelled and refused to work,\n arguing that \n had lapsed since \ns sinking and that he was no longer under orders. Shackleton's firm remonstrance finally brought the carpenter to heel, but the incident was never forgotten.\n Two days later, with only seven and a half miles (12.1 km) progress achieved in seven back-breaking days, Shackleton called a halt, observing: \"It would take us over three hundred days to reach the land\".\n The crew put up their tents and settled into what Shackleton called \"Patience Camp\", which would be their home for more than three months.\n\n\nSupplies were now running low. Hurley and Macklin were sent back to Ocean Camp to recover food that had been left there to lighten the sledging teams’ burden. On 2 February 1916, Shackleton sent a larger party back to recover the third lifeboat.\n Food shortages became acute as the weeks passed, and \n, which had added variety to their diet, now became a staple as Shackleton attempted to conserve the remaining packaged rations. In January, all but two teams of the dogs (whose overall numbers had been depleted by mishaps and illness in the preceding months) were shot on Shackleton's orders, because the dogs' requirements for seal meat were excessive.\n The final two teams were shot on 2 April, by which time their meat was a welcome addition to the rations.\n Meanwhile, the rate of drift became erratic; after being held at around 67° for several weeks, at the end of January there was a series of rapid north-eastward movements which, by 17 March, brought Patience Camp to the latitude of Paulet Island, but 60 nm (111 km) to its east. \"It might have been six hundred for all the chance we had of reaching it across the broken sea-ice\", Shackleton recorded.\n\n\nThe party now had land more or less continuously in sight. The peak of \n on \n remained in view as the party drifted slowly by.\n They were too far north for Snow Hill or Paulet Island to be accessible, and Shackleton's chief hopes were now fixed on two remaining small islands at the northern extremity of Graham Land. These were \n and \n, around 100 nautical miles (185 km) due north of their position on 25 March.\n He then decided \n might be a better target destination. This lay far to the west, toward the \n, but Shackleton thought it might be attainable by island-hopping. Its advantage was that it was sometimes visited by \n and might contain provisions, whereas Clarence Island and Elephant Island were desolate and unvisited.\n To reach any of these destinations would require a perilous journey in the lifeboats once the floe upon which they were drifting finally broke up. Earlier, the lifeboats had been named after the expedition's three chief financial sponsors: \n, \n and \n.\n\n\nThe end of Patience Camp was signalled on the evening of 8 April, when the floe suddenly split. The camp now found itself on a small triangular raft of ice; a break-up of this would mean disaster, so Shackleton readied the lifeboats for the party's enforced departure.\n He had now decided they would try, if possible, to reach the distant Deception Island because a small wooden church had been reportedly erected for the benefit of whalers. This could provide a source of timber that might enable them to construct a seaworthy boat.\n\n\nAt 1 p.m. on 9 April, the \n was launched, and an hour later all three boats were away. Shackleton himself commanded the \n, Worsley the \n, and navigating officer \n was nominally in charge of the \n, though because of his precarious mental state the effective commander was Tom Crean.\n\n\nThe boats were surrounded by ice, dependent upon leads of water opening up, and progress was perilous and erratic. Frequently the boats were tied to floes, or dragged up onto them, while the men camped and waited for conditions to improve.\n Shackleton was wavering again between several potential destinations, and on 12 April rejected the various island options and decided on \n, at the very tip of Graham Land. However, conditions in the boats, in temperatures sometimes as low as −20 °F (−29 °C), with little food and regular soakings in icy seawater, were wearing the men down, physically and mentally. Shackleton therefore decided that Elephant Island, the nearest of the possible refuges, was now the most practical option.\n\n\nOn 14 April, the boats lay off the south-east coast of Elephant Island, but could not land as the shore consisted of perpendicular cliffs and glaciers. Next day the \n rounded the eastern point of the island to reach the northern lee shore, and discovered a narrow shingle beach. Soon afterwards, the three boats, which had been separated during the previous night, were reunited at this landing place. It was apparent from high tide markings that this beach would not serve as a long-term camp,\n so the next day Wild and a crew set off in the \n to explore the coast for a safer site. They returned with news of a long spit of land, seven miles (11 km) to the west. With minimum delay the men returned to the boats and transferred to this new location, which they later christened Cape Wild.\n\n\nElephant Island was remote, uninhabited, and rarely visited by whalers or any other ships. If the party was to return to civilization it would be necessary to summon help. The only realistic way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300 km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island,\n because of the poor physical condition of many of his party. \n in the \n was closer than South Georgia but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.\n\n\nShackleton selected the boat party: himself, Worsley, Crean, McNish, and sailors \n and \n. On instructions from Shackleton, McNish immediately set about adapting the \n, improvising tools and materials.\n Wild was to be left in charge of the Elephant Island party, with instructions to make for Deception Island the following spring should Shackleton not return.\n Shackleton took supplies for only four weeks, judging that if land had not been reached within that time the boat would be lost.\n\n\nThe 22.5-foot (6.9 m) \n was launched on 24 April 1916. The success of the voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations that would have to be made in the most unfavourable of conditions.\n The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in icy water. Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May, a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in 26 years at sea.\n On 8 May, South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at \n.\n\n\nThe arrival of the \n at King Haakon Bay was followed by a period of rest and recuperation, while Shackleton pondered the next move. The populated whaling stations of South Georgia lay on the northern coast. To reach them would mean either another boat journey around the island, or a land crossing through its unexplored interior. The condition of the \n, and the physical state of the party, particularly Vincent and McNish, meant that the crossing was the only realistic option.\n\n\nAfter five days, the party took the boat a short distance eastwards, to the head of a deep bay which would be the starting point for the crossing. Shackleton, Worsley and Crean would undertake the land journey, the others remaining at what they christened \"\n\", to be picked up later after help had been obtained from the whaling stations. A storm on 18 May delayed their start, but by two o'clock the following morning the weather was clear and calm, and an hour later the crossing party set out.\n\n\nThe party's destination was the whaling station at \n, which had been \ns last \n on their outbound journey. This was roughly 26 miles (40 km) away, across the edge of the \n. Another whaling station was known to be at \n, just six miles (10 km) north of Peggotty Camp over easier terrain, but as far as the party was aware, this was only inhabited during the summer months. Shackleton and his men did not know that during their two-year absence in Antarctica, the station's owners had begun year-round operations.\n\n\nWithout a map, the route the party chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to 3,000 feet (910 m) and could see the northern coast. They were above \n, which meant they would need to move eastward to reach Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge.\n They travelled without rest on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge.\n\nEarly next morning, 20 May, seeing \n below them, the party knew that they were on the right path. At seven o'clock in the morning, they heard a steam whistle sound from Stromness, \"the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914\".\n After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.\n Shackleton wrote afterwards: \"I have no doubt that \n guided us ... I know that during that long and racking march of 36 hours over the unnamed mountains and glaciers it seemed to me often that we were four, not three\".\n This image of a fourth traveller was echoed in the accounts of Worsley and Crean and later influenced \n in the writing of his poem \n.\n  This phenomenon has been reported by other adventurers and is known as the \n.\n\nShackleton's first task, on arriving at the Stromness station, was to arrange for his three companions at Peggotty Camp to be picked up. A whaler was sent round the coast, with Worsley aboard to show the way, and by the evening of 21 May all six of the \n party were safe.\n\n\nIt took four attempts before Shackleton was able to return to Elephant Island to rescue the party stranded there. He first left South Georgia a mere three days after he had arrived in Stromness, after securing the use of a large whaler, \n, which was laid up in Husvik Harbour. Shackleton assembled a volunteer crew, which had it ready to sail by the morning of 22 May. As the vessel approached Elephant Island they saw that an impenetrable barrier of pack ice had formed, some 70 miles (110 km) from their destination. \n was not built for ice breaking, and retreated to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands.\n\n\nOn reaching Port Stanley, Shackleton informed London by cable of his whereabouts and requested that a suitable vessel be sent south for the rescue operation. He was informed by the Admiralty that nothing was available before October, which in his view was too late. Then, with the help of the British Minister in \n, Shackleton obtained from the Uruguayan government the loan of a tough trawler, \n, which started south on 10 June. Again the pack thwarted them. In search of another ship, Shackleton, Worsley and Crean travelled to \n, where they met Allan MacDonald, the British owner of the schooner \n. McDonald equipped this vessel for a further rescue attempt, which left on 12 July, but with the same negative result—the pack defeated them yet again.\n Shackleton later named a glacier after McDonald on the \n in the Weddell Sea. After problems arose in identifying this glacier, a nearby \n was renamed the \n.\n\nBy now it was mid-August, more than three months since Shackleton had left Elephant Island. Shackleton begged the Chilean Navy to lend him \n, a small steam tug that had assisted \n during the previous attempt. They agreed; on 25 August, \n—captained by captain of Chilean Navy \n—set out for Elephant Island. This time, as Shackleton recorded, providence favoured them. The seas were open, and the ship was able to approach close to the island in thick fog. At 11:40 a.m. on 30 August, the fog lifted, the camp was spotted and, within an hour, all the Elephant Island party were safely aboard, bound for Punta Arenas.\n\n\nAfter Shackleton left with the \n, Wild took command of the Elephant Island party, some of whom were in a low state, physically or mentally: \n had suffered a suspected heart attack; \n was unable to walk, due to \n feet; \n was depressed.\n The priority for the party was a permanent shelter against the rapidly approaching southern winter. On the suggestion of Marston and \n, a hut—nicknamed the \"Snuggery\"—was improvised by upturning the two boats and placing them on low stone walls, to provide around five feet (1.5 m) of headroom. By means of canvas and other materials the structure was made into a crude but effective shelter.\n\n\nWild initially estimated that they would have to wait one month for rescue, and refused to allow long-term stockpiling of seal and penguin meat because this, in his view, was defeatist.\n This policy led to sharp disagreements with Orde-Lees, the storekeeper, who was not a popular man and whose presence apparently did little to improve the morale of his companions, unless it was by way of being the butt of their jokes.\n\n\nAs the weeks extended well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities to relieve the tedium. A permanent lookout was kept for the arrival of the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin.\n Concerts were held on Saturdays and anniversaries were celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of rescue. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became \n from frostbite and, on 15 June, had to be amputated by surgeons Macklin and McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the last of the \n in their medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55 minutes and was a complete success.\n\n\nBy 23 August, it seemed that Wild's no-stockpiling policy had failed. The surrounding sea was dense with pack ice that would halt any rescue ship, food supplies were running out and no penguins were coming ashore. Orde-Lees wrote: \"We shall have to eat the one who dies first [...] there's many a true word said in jest\".\n Wild's thoughts were now seriously turning to the possibility of a boat trip to Deception Island—he planned to set out on 5 October, in the hope of meeting a whaling ship—\n when, on 30 August 1916, the ordeal ended suddenly with the appearance of Shackleton and \n.\n\n\n left Hobart on 24 December 1914, having been delayed in Australia by financial and organizational problems. The arrival in McMurdo Sound on 15 January 1915 was later in the season than planned, but the party's commander, Aeneas Mackintosh, made immediate plans for a depot-laying journey on the Ross Ice Shelf, since he understood that Shackleton hoped to attempt the crossing during that first season.\n Neither the men nor the dogs were acclimatised, and the party was, as a whole, very inexperienced in ice conditions. The first journey on the ice resulted in the loss of ten of the party's 18 dogs and a frostbitten and generally demoralised shore party; a single, incomplete depot was their only achievement.\n\n\nOn 7 May, \n, anchored at the party's \n headquarters, was wrenched from her moorings during a gale and carried with drifting ice far out to sea. Unable to return to McMurdo Sound, she remained captive in the ice for nine months until on 12 February 1916, having travelled a distance of around 1,600 miles (2,600 km), she reached open water and limped to New Zealand.\n \n carried with her the greater part of the shore party's fuel, food rations, clothing and equipment, although the sledging rations for the depots had been landed ashore. To continue with its mission the stranded shore party had to re-supply and re-equip itself from the leftovers from earlier expeditions, notably Scott's \n Expedition, which had been based at Cape Evans a few years earlier. They were thus able to begin the second season's depot-laying on schedule, in September 1915.\n\n\nIn the following months, the required depots were laid, at one-degree intervals across the Ross Ice Shelf to the foot of the Beardmore Glacier.\n On the return journey from the glacier the party contracted \n; \n, the expedition's chaplain and photographer, collapsed and died on the ice. The remainder of the party reached the temporary shelter of Hut Point, a relic of the \n Expedition at the southern end of McMurdo Sound, where they slowly recovered.\n On 8 May 1916, Mackintosh and \n decided to walk across the unstable sea ice to Cape Evans, were caught in a blizzard and were not seen again.\n The survivors eventually reached Cape Evans, but then had to wait for eight further months. Finally, on 10 January 1917, the repaired and refitted \n, whose departure from New Zealand had been delayed by lack of money, arrived to transport them back to civilization.\n Shackleton accompanied the ship as a supernumerary officer, having been denied command by the governments of New Zealand, Australia and Great Britain, who had jointly organised and financed the Ross Sea party's relief.\n\n\nThe rescued party, having had its last contact with civilization in 1914, was unaware of the course of the \n. News of Shackleton's safe arrival in the Falklands briefly eclipsed war news in the British newspapers on 2 June 1916.\n \n had a \"triumphal\" welcome in Punta Areas after its successful mission. The rescuees were then moved to the port of \n in \n where they had again a warm welcome, from there they were repatriated.\n The expedition returned home in piecemeal fashion, at a critical stage in the war, without the normal honours and civic receptions. When Shackleton himself finally arrived in England on 29 May 1917, after a short American lecture tour, his return was barely noticed.\n\n\nDespite McNish's efforts in preparing and sailing on the \n voyage, his prior insubordination meant that, on Shackleton's recommendation, he was one of four men denied the \n; the others whose contributions fell short of Shackleton's expected standards were \n, \n and \n.\n Most of the members of the expedition returned to take up immediate active military or naval service. Before the war ended, two—Tim McCarthy of the open boat journey and the veteran Antarctic sailor Alfred Cheetham—had been killed in action, and \n, Frank's younger brother and member of the Ross Sea party, had died of \n while serving in the Mediterranean. Several others were severely wounded, and many received decorations for gallantry.\n Following a propaganda mission in Buenos Aires, Shackleton was employed during the last weeks of the war on special service in \n, with the army rank of \n.\n This occupied him until March 1919. He thereafter organised one final Antarctic expedition, the \n on \n, which left London on 17 September 1921. From the \n crew, Wild, Worsley, Macklin, McIlroy, Hussey, \n, \n and cook \n all sailed with \n.\n\n\nShackleton died of a \n on 5 January 1922, while \n was anchored at South Georgia.\n After his death the original programme, which had included an exploration of Enderby Land,\n was abandoned. Wild led a brief cruise which brought them into sight of Elephant Island. They anchored off Cape Wild and were able to see the old landmarks, but sea conditions made it impossible for them to land.\n\n\nIt would be more than forty years before the first crossing of Antarctica was achieved, by the \n, 1955–1958. This expedition set out from \n, the same bay Shackleton was in sight of when the \n became trapped in ice. They followed a route which avoided the \n altogether, and bypassed much of the Ross Ice Shelf, reaching McMurdo Sound via a descent of the \n. The entire journey took 98 days.\n\n\nFor Chile, the rescue marked the beginning of the country's official operations in Antarctica.\n\n"},
{"title": "SY Aurora - Wikipedia", "content": "\n\n was a 580-\n barque-rigged\n \n built by \n Ltd. in \n, Scotland, in 1876,\n for the Dundee Seal and Whale Fishing Company. It was 165 feet (50 m) long with a 30-foot (9.1 m) beam. The hull was made of oak, sheathed with greenheart and lined with fir. The bow was a mass of solid wood reinforced with steel-plate armour. The heavy side frames were braced by two levels of horizontal oak beams. Its primary use was whaling in the northern seas, and it was built sturdily enough to withstand the heavy weather and ice that would be encountered there. That strength proved useful for Antarctic exploration as well and between 1911 and 1917 it made five trips to the continent, both for exploration and rescue missions.\n\nBetween the years 1876 and 1910, \n made the annual trip from \n to \n to take part in the whale and seal hunt in the North Atlantic. There were a couple of notable events in this time. In 1884,\n along with other whalers in the area \n made an attempt to rescue the controversial \n, and its captain, James Fairweather\n assisted with a repair to the US relief ship \n.\n In 1891, the ship came to the rescue of the crew of \n when it was crushed in sea ice.\n\n\nIn 1910, it was bought by \n's deputy, Captain \n, for £6,000 for his \n.\n On 2 December 1911 \n departed from \n, Australia for \n, where a radio relay station was established. It left the island on 25 December, arriving at \n on 8 January 1912, where the \n was built. It departed on 19 January, heading west to find a location for the western base, which was eventually sited in what is now known as Queen Mary Land, on 1 February 1912.  After the western party was established on the stable ice shelf, \n left on 20 February, arriving in Hobart on 12 March.\n\nIn December 1912, \n returned to Cape Denison to find that the sledging expedition of Mawson, \n, and \n was overdue. Davis had to pick up the party at the western base and risked the ship being iced in over the winter if he left it too long.  He waited until 8 February but just after leaving, he received a wireless message asking him to turn back as Mawson had reached the base. He turned \n around but severe weather prevented the landing boat being put ashore, so, on the evening of 9 February, Davis decided he must steam west to fetch the western base party. \n reached the western base on 23 February, loaded quickly and headed north, arriving in Hobart on 15 March.\n\nOver the subsequent months, Davis raised extensive rescue funds, and had \n refitted. Departing from Hobart on 15 November 1913, \n collected the radio relay party under \n at Macquarie Island, and sailed on to pick up the relief party at Cape Denison. It arrived in \n on 3 December 1913 and left on 25 December. After an extensive coastal exploration and oceanographic work, it arrived back in Australia at Port Adelaide on 26 February 1914.\n\nIn 1914, Sir \n tasked \n to help set up supply depots along the route for his \n. After being delayed by \n in \n in January 1915, \n managed to make its way further south, and sent teams off to set up the depots. It eventually made its way to \n on 12 March 1915, where it anchored and continued to offload supplies. In May, \n was trapped in the ice, and was carried out to the sea, stranding the men that were setting up the depots. It remained trapped in the ice for the better part of a year, drifting some 1600 nautical miles. It was not until 12 February 1916 that the ship escaped from the ice, making it back to \n, \n on 3 April.\n\nThe Australian, New Zealand and British governments agreed to fund the refit of \n for the rescue of the \n. An Advisory Committee was established in \n, consisting of \n, \n, Captain J.R. Barter, \n and \n.\n\n\nShackleton's expedition funds were fully expended. After his legendary ordeal on \n in the \n sector, Shackleton arrived in \n during December 1916. The three governments involved were adamant that he would not lead the rescue expedition and at their insistence \n was appointed to captain \n. After negotiation Shackleton sailed aboard \n, but Captain Davis had total authority on the voyage. On 10 January 1917, the ship pulled alongside the pack ice near \n and worked its way to \n. One week later, the seven survivors of the original ten members of the \n were headed back to \n aboard \n.\n\n was last seen in 1917, when it departed \n, bound for \n, Chile with a cargo of coal. \n posted the ship as missing on 2 January 1918; it was believed it was a casualty of World War I, possibly being sunk by a mine laid by the German \n \n. One of \n \n was recovered from the \n between \n and \n six months after its disappearance.\n\n\nIn 1927, a G. Bressington was walking along the beach near \n and noticed an old wine bottle partly buried in the sand. Upon examining the bottle he saw an engraving of the picture of a ship and on the other side the following message: \"Midwinter's Day, 1912, Shackleton Glacier, Antarctica. 'Frank Wild, A. L. Kennedy, S. Evan Jones, C. Arch. Hoadley, Charles T. Harrisson, George Dovers, A. L. Watson and Morton H. Moyes\".\n\n\nThe story of the bottle is that it was one of three given to Sir Douglas Mawson when his expedition left England in 1911. The bottles were given by Mr J. T. Buchanan who had them left over from the \n and wished the party to drink them on Explorer Day. Mawson passed one bottle on to \n, who led the Western Base Party whilst \n was under the command of John King Davis. When the wine was drunk on the day, the party's artist Harrisson engraved a picture of \non one side and the names of the party on the other. It is thought the bottle was still aboard \n when it left Newcastle in 1917.\n\nA number of Antarctic features are named for \n.  These include:\n\nThis is a partial list of \n of \n:\n"},
